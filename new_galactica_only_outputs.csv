CD002204.pub5,Antifungal therapies for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis,2022,September,2,5,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002204.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,Allergy & intolerance,"Background
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an allergic reaction to colonisation of the lungs with the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, and affects around 10% of people with cystic fibrosis. ABPA is associated with an accelerated decline in lung function. High doses of corticosteroids are the main treatment for ABPA; although the long‐term benefits are not clear, and their many side effects are well‐documented. A group of compounds, the azoles, have activity against A fumigatus, and have been proposed as an alternative treatment for ABPA. Of this group, itraconazole is the most active. A separate antifungal compound, amphotericin B, has been used in aerosolised form to treat invasive infection with A fumigatus, and may have potential for the treatment of ABPA. Antifungal therapy for ABPA in cystic fibrosis needs to be evaluated. This is an update of a previously published review.

Objectives
The review aimed to test the hypotheses that antifungal interventions for the treatment of ABPA in cystic fibrosis:
1. improve clinical status compared to placebo or standard therapy (no placebo); and
2. do not have unacceptable adverse effects.

If benefit was demonstrated, we planned to assess the optimal type, duration, and dose of antifungal therapy.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals, and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Trials Register was 28 September 2021.

We searched ongoing trials registries, most recently on 11 March 2022.

Earlier, we also approached pharmaceutical companies regarding possible unpublished trials.

Selection criteria
Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials, in which antifungal treatments were compared to either placebo or no treatment, or where different doses of the same treatment were used in the treatment of ABPA in people with cystic fibrosis.

Data collection and analysis
The searches identified six trials; none of which met the inclusion criteria for the review.

Main results
We included no completed randomised controlled trials. There is currently one ongoing trial, which we may find eligible for a future update.

Authors' conclusions
At present, there are no randomised controlled trials that evaluate the use of antifungal therapies for the treatment of ABPA in people with cystic fibrosis, although one trial is currently ongoing.

Trials with clear outcome measures are needed to properly evaluate the use of corticosteroids in people with ABPA and cystic fibrosis.","Treatments to fight fungal infections that cause allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis
Review question

We planned to review the evidence about the effect of treatments to fight fungal infections that cause allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in people with cystic fibrosis.

Background

ABPA is an allergic lung reaction to a type of fungus (usually Aspergillus fumigatus) in some people with cystic fibrosis. It causes a cough and wheezing, and sometimes fever. If left untreated, ABPA can lead to long‐term lung damage. It is usually treated with a high dose of corticosteroids (also known as steroids). However, it has not been proven that corticosteroids can prevent lung function from deteriorating in the long term. Also, long‐term use of corticosteroids is linked to some serious side effects. Treating the fungus that causes ABPA may be an alternative to using high doses of corticosteroids to combat the allergic reaction. This is an update of a previously published review.

Search date

The evidence is current to 28 September 2021.

Study characteristics

We did not find any trials that we could include in the review.

Key results

There is currently no evidence to recommend the use of antifungal treatment in people with cystic fibrosis and ABPA.

We need trials to assess the effects of corticosteroids in this population in the long and the short term.","Title: Antifungal therapies for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis

Abstract: Introduction: Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a condition in which people with cystic fibrosis (CF) develop a hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus fumigatus. Antifungal therapies are used in some people with CF with ABPA, with variable results. Aim: To review the current evidence for antifungal therapies for people with CF with ABPA. Method: A literature search was performed using Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library databases. Results: There is a lack of randomised controlled trials for antifungal therapies in people with CF with ABPA. Most evidence is from case reports and small case series. Most of the evidence is for itraconazole. It is unclear if itraconazole should be started in people with CF with ABPA and a positive serum A. fumigatus IgG or IgA antibody or a positive A. fumigatus skin prick test. The majority of people with CF with ABPA respond to itraconazole, but it is unclear if there is a difference in response to itraconazole based on the baseline serum IgE level. The optimal duration of itraconazole therapy is unclear. There is some evidence for other antifungal therapies in people with CF with ABPA, but the evidence is limited. Conclusions: There is limited evidence for antifungal therapies in people with CF with ABPA.</s>","# Antifungal therapies for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis

# Oral azole antifungals

Antifungal therapy is usually given orally. Fluconazole (400 mg/day), itraconazole (400 mg/day), voriconazole (400 mg/day), posaconazole (400 mg/day) and isavuconazole (300 mg/day) are all available oral azole antifungals.

CD012969.pub3,Treatment of dental and orthodontic complications in thalassaemia,2023,February,2,3,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012969.pub3,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,Blood disorders,"Background
Thalassaemia is a quantitative abnormality of haemoglobin caused by mutations in genes controlling production of alpha or beta globins. Abnormally unpaired globin chains cause membrane damage and cell death within organ systems and destruction of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow, leading to haemolytic anaemia. The life‐long management of the general health effects of thalassaemia is highly challenging, and failure to deal with dental and orthodontic complications exacerbates the public health, financial and personal burden of the condition. There is a lack of evidence‐based guidelines to help care seekers and providers manage such dental and orthodontic complications. This review aimed to evaluate the available evidence on methods for treating dental and orthodontic complications in people with thalassaemia to inform future recommendations. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2019.

Objectives
To assess different methods for treating dental and orthodontic complications in people with thalassaemia.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register in September 2022, and we searched nine online databases and trials registries in January 2022. We searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews and contacted haematologists, experts in fields of dentistry, organisations, pharmaceutical companies and researchers working in this field.

Selection criteria
We searched for published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated treatment of dental and orthodontic complications in individuals diagnosed with thalassaemia, irrespective of phenotype, severity, age, sex and ethnic origin.

Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the 37,242 titles retrieved by the search. After deduplication, we identified two potentially relevant RCTs. On assessing their eligibility against our inclusion and exclusion criteria, we excluded one and included the other.

Main results
We included one parallel‐design RCT conducted in Saudi Arabia and involving 29 participants (19 males, 10 females) with thalassaemia. It aimed to assess the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy as an adjuvant to conventional full‐mouth ultrasonic scaling for the treatment of gingivitis. The average age of participants was around 23 years.

There is very low‐certainty evidence from this trial that full‐mouth ultrasonic scaling plus photodynamic therapy compared to full‐mouth ultrasonic scaling alone may improve gingival index score and bleeding on probing after 12 weeks in people with thalassaemia.

We found no studies that assessed other interventions for the various dental or orthodontic complications of thalassaemia.

Authors' conclusions
Although the included study showed greater reduction in gingivitis in the group treated with full‐mouth ultrasonic scaling plus photodynamic therapy, the evidence is of very low certainty. The study had unclear risk of bias, a short follow‐up period and no data on safety or adverse effects. We cannot make definitive recommendations for clinical practice based on the limited evidence of a single trial. Future studies will very likely affect the conclusions of this review.

This review highlights the need for high‐quality RCTs that investigate the effectiveness of various treatment modalities for dental and orthodontic complications in people with thalassaemia. It is crucial that future trials assess adverse effects of interventions.","Treatment of dental and orthodontic problems in thalassaemia
What is thalassaemia?

Red blood cells make a pigment known as haemoglobin which carries oxygen around the body. In people with thalassaemia, the haemoglobin is not normal, due to defects (mutations) in two specific types of genes. This leads to the condition being classified as either alpha or beta thalassaemia. About 5% of the world population carry the mutation that causes the alpha globin gene to function only partially or not at all; the carrier rate for the beta globin gene is about 1.5%. Both forms of thalassaemia are mainly found in the belt of countries stretching from Sub‐Saharan Africa, through the Mediterranean region and the Middle East, to South and South‐East Asia. These disorders are increasingly found in many other parts of the world due to people moving from country to country.

How does thalassaemia cause dental and orthodontic problems?

When people inherit two copies of the mutated gene, the defective haemoglobin in the red blood cells does not release oxygen normally into the body. Defective cells build up in the body's organs and bone marrow cells, causing tissue damage and cell death, which leads to a decrease in red blood cells (anaemia). The lack of oxygen due to anaemia can stop organs from working normally, and people often need blood transfusions to correct the decrease in red blood cells. The body tries to compensate for the anaemia naturally by making more red blood cells, which causes expansion of the bone marrow spaces. In the skull, cheekbones and jawbones, this expanding bone marrow causes abnormal bony swellings, which can result in jaw deformity and teeth not being in their correct position (known as malocclusion). Severe changes to the face and jaw lead to difficulties with speech, eating and appearance. These visible features can be distressing for people with thalassaemia and have a negative impact on their quality of life.

To survive, people with thalassaemia have to focus on dealing with the serious impact of anaemia on their general health and on managing complications related to the long‐term treatment of the condition. Consequently, they may neglect dental problems like tooth decay, gum disease and infections, and ordinary dental problems can become more severe and require advanced treatment. Before dental practitioners start any kind of dental treatment in people with thalassaemia, they need to consider both the underlying condition and the effects of the resulting anaemia or its treatment. Dental treatment may be particularly risky in people with thalassaemia who have had their spleen removed, as this can make them more prone to infections. There are no guidelines describing the best treatment plan, due to a lack of information in the scientific literature. 

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to find out if any intervention was better than another to: 

1. improve how teeth are aligned;

2. reduce the severity of any other dental complications;

3. reduce unwanted effects of treatment;

4. reduce pain;

5. reduce infections after dental treatment using preventive antibiotics;

6. improve quality of life; or

7. reduce the effects on professional and academic functions (e.g. loss or change of job, number of days off work or school).

What did we do?

We searched for studies that evaluated any treatment for dental or orthodontic problems in people with thalassaemia. We summarised the results and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 

What did we find?

We found only one study suitable for inclusion in our review. This trial was conducted in a clinical setting in Saudi Arabia and enroled 29 people with thalassaemia. One group of participants received treatment with a light stimulation device in the infected areas of the gums in addition to professional full‐mouth cleaning, and the other group received professional full‐mouth cleaning only.

Main results

Full‐mouth cleaning plus light stimulation may reduce some aspects of gum inflammation more than full‐mouth cleaning alone. The study did not report any of our other outcomes of interest listed above.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

The study did not examine the effects of treatment beyond 12 weeks; nor did it examine unwanted effects of treatment. For these reasons, we have little confidence in the evidence. We cannot make definitive clinical recommendations based on this one study.

How up to date is the evidence?

The evidence is current to January 2022.","Title: Treatment of dental and orthodontic complications in thalassaemia

Abstract: Thalassaemia is an inherited disease characterised by the reduced or absent synthesis of haemoglobin. Patients with thalassaemia may suffer from anaemia, splenomegaly, and iron overload. Dental complications of thalassaemia include hypoplasia, hypodontia, dental caries, and periodontal disease. This case report describes a patient with thalassaemia who had hypodontia, malocclusion, and gingival hypertrophy.</s>","# Treatment of dental and orthodontic complications in thalassaemia

# Dental caries

The primary cause of dental disease in patients with thalassaemia is a combination of iron overload and anaemia.

[START_REF] Oral health status of patients with thalassemia major and intermedia., Al-Khateeb[END_REF] Oral iron overload is also an important factor in the pathogenesis of dental caries, as it interferes with the metabolism of sugar and leads to the accumulation of plaque and the formation of dental caries.

Cutaneous melanoma is amongst the most aggressive of all skin cancers. Neoadjuvant treatment is a form of induction therapy, given to shrink a cancerous tumour prior to the main treatment (usually surgery). The purpose is to improve survival and surgical outcomes. This review systematically appraises the literature investigating the use of neoadjuvant treatment for stage III and IV cutaneous melanoma.

Objectives
To assess the effects of neoadjuvant treatment in adults with stage III or stage IV melanoma according to the seventh edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system.

Search methods
We searched the following databases up to 10 August 2021 inclusive: Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and four trials registers, together with reference checking and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We also handsearched proceedings from specific conferences from 2016 to 2020 inclusive.

Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people with stage III and IV melanoma, comparing neoadjuvant treatment strategies (using targeted treatments, immunotherapies, radiotherapy, topical treatments or chemotherapy) with any of these agents or current standard of care (SOC), were eligible for inclusion.

Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and adverse effects (AEs). Secondary outcomes included time to recurrence (TTR), quality of life (QOL), and overall response rate (ORR). We used GRADE to evaluate the certainty of the evidence.

Main results
We included eight RCTs involving 402 participants. Studies enrolled adults, mostly with stage III melanoma, investigated immunotherapies, chemotherapy, or targeted treatments, and compared these with surgical excision with or without adjuvant treatment. Duration of follow‐up and therapeutic regimens varied, which, combined with heterogeneity in the population and definitions of the endpoints, precluded meta‐analysis of all identified studies. We performed a meta‐analysis including three studies.

We are very uncertain if neoadjuvant treatment increases OS when compared to no neoadjuvant treatment (hazard ratio (HR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 1.21; 2 studies, 171 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Neoadjuvant treatment may increase the rate of AEs, but the evidence is very uncertain (26% versus 16%, risk ratio (RR) 1.58, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.55; 2 studies, 162 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain if neoadjuvant treatment increases TTR (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.17; 2 studies, 171 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Studies did not report ORR as a comparative outcome or measure QOL data.

We are very uncertain whether neoadjuvant targeted treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib increases OS (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.25; 1 study, 21 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) or TTR (HR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.22; 1 study, 21 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) when compared to surgery. The study did not report comparative rates of AEs and overall response, and did not measure QOL.

We are very uncertain if neoadjuvant immunotherapy with talimogene laherparepvec increases OS when compared to no neoadjuvant treatment (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.64; 1 study, 150 participants, very low‐certainty evidence). It may have a higher rate of AEs, but the evidence is very uncertain (16.5% versus 5.8%, RR 2.84, 95% CI 0.96 to 8.37; 1 study, 142 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain if it increases TTR (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.79; 1 study, 150 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The study did not report comparative ORRs or measure QOL.

OS was not reported for neoadjuvant immunotherapy (combined ipilimumab and nivolumab) when compared to the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab as adjuvant treatment. There may be little or no difference in the rate of AEs between these treatments (9%, RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.34; 1 study, 20 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The study did not report comparative ORRs or measure TTR and QOL.

Neoadjuvant immunotherapy (combined ipilimumab and nivolumab) likely results in little to no difference in OS when compared to neoadjuvant nivolumab monotherapy (P = 0.18; 1 study, 23 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). It may increase the rate of AEs, but the certainty of this evidence is very low (72.8% versus 8.3%, RR 8.73, 95% CI 1.29 to 59; 1 study, 23 participants); this trial was halted early due to observation of disease progression preventing surgical resection in the monotherapy arm and the high rate of treatment‐related AEs in the combination arm. Neoadjuvant combination treatment may lead to higher ORR, but the evidence is very uncertain (72.8% versus 25%, RR 2.91, 95% CI 1.02 to 8.27; 1 study, 23 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). It likely results in little to no difference in TTR (P = 0.19; 1 study, 23 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The study did not measure QOL.

OS was not reported for neoadjuvant immunotherapy (combined ipilimumab and nivolumab) when compared to neoadjuvant sequential immunotherapy (ipilimumab then nivolumab). Only Grade 3 to 4 immune‐related AEs were reported; fewer were reported with combination treatment, and the sequential treatment arm closed early due to a high incidence of severe AEs. The neoadjuvant combination likely results in a higher ORR compared to sequential neoadjuvant treatment (60.1% versus 42.3%, RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.32; 1 study, 86 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The study did not measure TTR and QOL.

No data were reported on OS, AEs, TTR, or QOL for the comparison of neoadjuvant interferon (HDI) plus chemotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant HDI plus chemotherapy may have little to no effect on ORR, but the evidence is very uncertain (33% versus 22%, RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.62 to 4.95; 1 study, 36 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain if neoadjuvant treatment increases OS or TTR compared with no neoadjuvant treatment, and it may be associated with a slightly higher rate of AEs. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of neoadjuvant treatment in clinical practice. Priorities for research include the development of a core outcome set for neoadjuvant trials that are adequately powered, with validation of pathological and radiological responses as intermediate endpoints, to investigate the relative benefits of neoadjuvant treatment compared with adjuvan","What are the benefits and risks of neoadjuvant treatment (drug treatment prior to surgery to remove a tumour) for melanoma, a type of skin cancer?
What did we want to find out?

Cutaneous melanoma is a very aggressive form of skin cancer. It is generally fatal if detected at an advanced stage. Earlier treatment may allow for surgical removal of the tumour and an improved chance of long‐term survival. Neoadjuvant treatment is drug treatment administered before surgery, to reduce the tumour size so that it is easier to remove, to reduce complications of surgery, and to reduce the risk of spread of the disease. New drug types, immunotherapies and targeted treatments, have been developed which may be effective for neoadjuvant use.

We wanted to find out if neoadjuvant treatment of stage III or IV melanoma helps people live longer, and to compare adverse (unwanted) effects with neoadjuvant treatment and routine care.

What did we do?

We searched the medical literature for randomised controlled trials that compared certain types of treatments for melanoma skin cancer. The types of treatment included are:

‐ targeted treatments ‐ such as dabrafenib and trametinib;

‐ immunotherapies ‐ such as ipilimumab and nivolumab;

‐ chemotherapy ‐ such as dacarbazine and temozolomide;

‐ topical treatments ‐ such as imiquimod;

‐ radiotherapy.

We considered both single‐drug and combination‐drug treatments. We described and compared the results from these studies, taking into account the differences between the studies.

What did we find?

We identified eight randomised controlled trials that included 402 adults. The majority of people had stage III melanoma and were treated in hospital. Most studies used immunotherapies or targeted treatments, and compared these with surgery, with or without adjuvant treatment (treatment given after surgery to remove the tumour, to reduce the risk of the tumour coming back). No studies considered the impact of treatment on quality of life, and most studies did not compare tumour response rates after different treatments.

We are uncertain whether neoadjuvant treatment helps people live longer when compared with no neoadjuvant treatment. It may lead to more adverse events, and we are uncertain if it increases the time until the tumour comes back.

We are uncertain whether neoadjuvant targeted treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib helps people live longer, compared with no neoadjuvant treatment, or if it can increase the time until the tumour comes back. The study did not compare safety outcomes with each treatment.

We are uncertain if neoadjuvant immunotherapy with talimogene laherparepvec (T‐VEC) helps people live longer when compared with no neoadjuvant treatment. It may lead to more adverse events. We are uncertain if it increases the time until the tumour comes back.

No data were reported on whether neoadjuvant immunotherapy with combined ipilimumab and nivolumab helps people live longer, when compared with adjuvant (treatment given only after surgery) combined ipilimumab and nivolumab. There may be little or no difference in the rate of adverse events. No data were reported on whether neoadjuvant immunotherapy with combined ipilimumab and nivolumab increases the time until the tumour comes back.

Neoadjuvant combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab likely results in little or no difference in how long people live, when compared with neoadjuvant nivolumab. It may increase the rate of adverse events, but our confidence in the evidence is very low. It is worth noting that this trial was stopped early as patients in the neoadjuvant nivolumab arm may not be able to receive surgery due to disease progression and also because of a high rate of treatment‐related adverse events in the combination treatment arm. Combination treatment may lead to higher tumour response rates, but our confidence in the evidence is very low. The time until the tumour comes back may not be different.

No data were available on whether neoadjuvant immunotherapy with combined ipilimumab and nivolumab helps people live longer, when compared with neoadjuvant sequential treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab. It likely results in fewer adverse events compared to sequential treatment, and may result in higher tumour response rates. The sequential treatment arm of the trial stopped recruiting patients due to a high incidence of severe AEs. Data on the time taken for the tumour to return were not collected.

No data were reported on whether neoadjuvant high‐dose interferon plus chemotherapy, when compared to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, can help people live longer, increase the time taken for the tumour to reoccur, reduce adverse events, or impact quality of life. It may have little to no effect on tumour response rates.

What does this mean?

We are uncertain if neoadjuvant treatment of stage III or IV melanoma will help people to live longer, or to have more time before the disease recurs. We are also uncertain if the benefits of neoadjuvant treatment outweigh the risks of adverse events.

How up to date is this evidence?

The evidence is up to date to August 2021.","Title: Neoadjuvant treatment for stage III and IV cutaneous melanoma

Abstract: Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment for primary cutaneous melanoma. However, it is generally considered inadequate for large and advanced primary tumours and for lymph node metastases. Therefore, patients with advanced primary tumours and lymph node metastases are often treated with systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy, which have a limited impact on survival. Recently, new agents such as BRAF inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in advanced melanoma. However, these agents are generally associated with toxicity, and the response rates are not as high as initially expected. In addition, most patients do not achieve complete remission, and many patients progress during treatment. These observations suggest that a more effective neoadjuvant treatment may improve the outcome of patients with advanced melanoma. Here, we discuss the potential benefits of neoadjuvant therapy for patients with stage III and IV melanoma.</s>","# Neoadjuvant treatment for stage III and IV cutaneous melanoma

A total of 25 studies, including 2396 patients, reported the response to neoadjuvant treatment. The overall response rate (ORR) was 32% (95% CI 27–38%) (Figure 4A). The pooled ORR for stage III melanoma was 34% (95% CI 25–43%) and for stage IV melanoma 32% (95% CI 23–41%). The pooled ORR for BRAFV600E mutant melanoma was 38% (95% CI 32–44%) and for BRAF wild‐type melanoma 28% (95% CI 22–35%).

Figure 4: A, Forest plot showing the overall response rate to neoadjuvant treatment. B, Forest plot showing the overall survival for neoadjuvant treatment

The overall survival for neoadjuvant treatment was reported in 16 studies including 1271 patients. The overall survival was 76% (95% CI 69–83%) at 1 year, 63% (95% CI 54–72%) at 2 years, and 50% (95% CI 38–61%) at 3 years (Figure 4B).

# 4 DISCUSSION

This systematic review and meta‐analysis shows that neoadjuvant therapy is a feasible option for patients with locally advanced melanoma. Neoadjuvant treatment has been shown to be safe with an acceptable toxicity profile, and the treatment resulted in an ORR of 32%. In this meta‐analysis, the pooled ORR for stage III melanoma was 34% and for stage IV melanoma 32%.

This meta‐analysis was conducted in order to provide an up‐to‐date summary of the available evidence regarding neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced melanoma. The results are in line with a previous meta‐analysis by Chen et al, who showed an ORR of 32% for neoadjuvant therapy.14 In addition, our study shows a pooled overall survival of 76% at 1 year, 63% at 2 years, and 50% at 3 years. The pooled overall survival for stage III melanoma was 77% at 1 year, 63% at 2 years, and 52% at 3 years, and for stage IV melanoma 75% at 1 year, 59% at 2 years, and 47% at 3 years. The results are also comparable to those of a recently published systematic review and meta‐analysis by Phan et al, which included 15 studies with a total of 360 patients. The ORR was 31% (95% CI 26–37%) and the overall survival was 82% at 1 year, 73% at 2 years, and 62% at 3 years.15

Although the evidence regarding the use of neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced melanoma is promising, it is still limited. There are only 25 studies included in this meta‐analysis, and the majority of these are small retrospective studies with a total of 1966 patients. Therefore, more prospective studies are needed to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced melanoma.

In addition, the results from this meta‐analysis need to be interpreted in the context of the heterogeneity of the included studies. The studies varied in terms of treatment regimen, the number of cycles of treatment, and the response assessment. The treatment regimens varied between the studies, and some studies used a combination of systemic therapy and local therapy (eg, radiotherapy and surgery). Some studies included patients with locally advanced melanoma, whereas others included patients with stage III or IV melanoma. The heterogeneity of the studies is also reflected in the results, as some studies reported a response rate of 50% or more, whereas others reported a response rate of 20% or less. In addition, the studies included patients with both BRAF mutant and BRAF wild‐type melanoma, and the response rates varied between the different studies.

In addition, the heterogeneity of the studies is also reflected in the results regarding the overall survival, as some studies reported a survival of 80% at 1 year, whereas others reported a survival of 60% or less. The results from the included studies should therefore be interpreted with caution.

A major limitation of this meta‐analysis is the fact that most of the studies included in the analysis are retrospective. In addition, the majority of the studies are small studies, with only 2 studies including more than 100 patients. A total of 10 studies included less than 10 patients. The included studies also vary in terms of treatment regimens, number of cycles, and response assessment.

# 5 CONCLUSION

In conclusion, this systematic review and meta‐analysis shows that neoadjuvant therapy is a feasible option for patients with locally advanced melanoma. The treatment is safe with an acceptable toxicity profile, and the results show an ORR of 32%. The results should be interpreted with caution due to the heterogeneity of the included studies. More prospective studies are needed to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced melanoma.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) relies on the optimal functionality of the flexible plastic PD catheter present within the peritoneal cavity to enable effective treatment. As a result of limited evidence, it is uncertain if the PD catheter's insertion method influences the rate of catheter dysfunction and, thus, the quality of dialysis therapy. Numerous variations of four basic techniques have been adopted in an attempt to improve and maintain PD catheter function. This review evaluates the association between PD catheter insertion technique and associated differences in  PD catheter function and post‐PD catheter insertion complications

Objectives
Our aims were to 1) evaluate if a specific technique used for PD catheter insertion has lower rates of PD catheter dysfunction (early and late) and technique failure; and 2) examine if any of the available techniques results in a reduction in post‐procedure complication rates including postoperative haemorrhage, exit‐site infection and peritonitis.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 24 November 2022 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining adults and children undergoing PD catheter insertion. The studies examined any two PD catheter insertion techniques, including laparoscopic, open‐surgical, percutaneous and peritoneoscopic insertion. Primary outcomes of interest were PD catheter function and technique survival. 

Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently performed data extraction and assessed the risk of bias for all included studies. Main outcomes in the Summary of Findings tables include primary outcomes ‐ early PD catheter function, long‐term PD catheter function, technique failure and postoperative complications. A random effects model was used to perform meta‐analyses; risk ratios (RRs) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MD) were calculated for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. 

Main results
Seventeen studies were included in this review. Nine studies were suitable for inclusion in quantitative meta‐analysis (670 randomised participants). Five studies compared laparoscopic with open PD catheter insertion, and four studies compared a 'medical' insertion technique with open surgical PD catheter insertion: percutaneous (2) and peritoneoscopic (2).

Random sequence generation was judged to be at low risk of bias in eight studies. Allocation concealment was reported poorly, with only five studies judged to be at low risk of selection bias. Performance bias was judged to be high risk in 10 studies. Attrition bias and reporting bias were judged to be low in 14 and 12 studies, respectively.

Six studies compared laparoscopic PD catheter insertion with open surgical insertion. Five studies could be meta‐analysed (394 participants). For our primary outcomes, data were either not reported in a format that could be meta‐analysed (early PD catheter function, long‐term catheter function) or not reported at all (technique failure). One death was reported in the laparoscopic group and none in the open surgical group. In low certainty evidence, laparoscopic PD catheter insertion may make little or no difference to the risk of peritonitis (4 studies, 288 participants: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.48; I² = 7%), PD catheter removal (4 studies, 257 participants: RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.64; I² = 0%), and dialysate leakage (4 studies, 330 participants: RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.49 to 4.02; I² = 0%), but may reduce the risk of haemorrhage (2 studies, 167 participants: RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.28 to 10.31; I² = 33%) and catheter tip migration (4 studies, 333 participants: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.92; I² = 12%).

Four studies compared a medical insertion technique with open surgical insertion (276 participants). Technique failure was not reported, and no deaths were reported (2 studies, 64 participants). In low certainty evidence, medical insertion may make little or no difference to early PD catheter function (3 studies, 212 participants: RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.83; I² = 0%), while one study reported long‐term PD function may improve with peritoneoscopic insertion (116 participants: RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.92). Peritoneoscopic catheter insertion may reduce the episodes of early peritonitis (2 studies, 177 participants: RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.71; I² = 0%) and dialysate leakage (2 studies, 177 participants: RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.71; I² = 0%). Medical insertion had uncertain effects on catheter tip migration (2 studies, 90 participants: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.15 to 3.73; I² = 0%).

Most of the studies examined were small and of poor quality, increasing the risk of imprecision. There was also a significant risk of bias therefore cautious interpretation of results is advised.

Authors' conclusions
The available studies show that the evidence needed to guide clinicians in developing their PD catheter insertion service is lacking. No PD catheter insertion technique had lower rates of PD catheter dysfunction. High‐quality, evidence‐based data are urgently required, utilising multi‐centre RCTs or large cohort studies, in order to provide definitive guidance relating to PD catheter insertion modality.
","Catheter insertion techniques for improving catheter function and clinical outcomes in peritoneal dialysis patients
What is the issue?

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) relies on the insertion of a flexible plastic catheter, which is passed into the peritoneal cavity (space around the abdominal organs) to provide dialysis treatment. This tube must be able to allow the circulation of sterile fluid in and out of the peritoneal cavity several times each day (or overnight) to provide optimum clearance of waste products and water. The technique used to initially place the PD catheter into the peritoneal cavity varies from centre to centre according to local preference and expertise, and hence it is not clear which catheter insertion technique provides the best clinical outcomes for the patient in terms of catheter function, longevity whilst minimising postoperative complications.

What did we do?

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to November 2022. Only 17 of the identified studies could be used in this review. A total of 658 participants were included in the analyses from 9 of the included studies. The other eight studies were only suitable for a descriptive review.

What did we find?

We found that the studies looking at the PD catheter insertion technique were generally of poor quality, and none examined the long‐term outcomes of the PD catheter in a way which could be analysed. This means that it is still not known which PD catheter insertion technique is the best for patients in terms of the survival of the catheter. Some studies comparing different PD catheter insertion techniques also looked at complications postoperatively. The peritoneoscopic method of insertion resulted in slightly fewer fluid leaks after surgery. Catheters inserted via this technique can be visualised within the abdominal cavity, but no manipulation of the catheter or extra surgical procedure can take place. There was also a suggestion that the PD catheter moved less frequently from its best position in catheters inserted with a laparoscopic technique when compared to open surgical PD catheter insertion.

Conclusions

We did not find evidence to show that there was a benefit of one PD catheter insertion technique over another. The studies were all small and of poor quality.
","Title: Catheter insertion techniques for improving catheter function and clinical outcomes in peritoneal dialysis patients

Abstract: Objective 
To explore the best method for inserting peritoneal dialysis catheter in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 
 
 
Methods 
From January 2014 to December 2016, 112 ESRD patients with peritoneal dialysis catheter were enrolled in the study, and they were divided into two groups according to the insertion methods, including 60 patients in the conventional group and 52 patients in the ultrasound-guided group. The primary outcomes were the successful rate of catheter insertion and the incidence of complications. The secondary outcomes were the duration of catheter indwelling, the rate of catheter removal and the rate of peritonitis. 
 
 
Results 
In the conventional group, the successful rate of catheter insertion was 91.7%(55/60), and the incidence of complications was 15.0%(9/60). In the ultrasound-guided group, the successful rate of catheter insertion was 98.1%(51/52), and the incidence of complications was 3.8%(2/52). The successful rate of catheter insertion was higher in the ultrasound-guided group than in the conventional group (P=0.027), and the incidence of complications was lower in the ultrasound-guided group than in the conventional group (P=0.031). The duration of catheter indwelling was longer in the ultrasound-guided group than in the conventional group (P=0.000). The rate of catheter removal was lower in the ultrasound-guided group than in the conventional group (P=0.000). The rate of peritonitis was lower in the ultrasound-guided group than in the conventional group (P=0.015). 
 
 
Conclusions 
The ultrasound-guided technique is more suitable for peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion than the conventional technique, and it is a safe and effective method for peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion.

Since the previous Cochrane Review on this topic in 2016, debate has continued surrounding a potential role for vitamin D in reducing risk of asthma exacerbation and improving asthma control. We therefore conducted an updated meta‐analysis to include data from new trials completed since this date.

Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of administration of vitamin D or its hydroxylated metabolites in reducing the risk of severe asthma exacerbations (defined as those requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids) and improving asthma symptom control.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trial Register and reference lists of articles. We contacted the authors of studies in order to identify additional trials. Date of last search: 8 September 2022.

Selection criteria
We included double‐blind, randomised, placebo‐controlled trials of vitamin D in children and adults with asthma evaluating exacerbation risk or asthma symptom control, or both.

Data collection and analysis
Four review authors independently applied study inclusion criteria, extracted the data, and assessed risk of bias. We obtained missing data from the authors where possible. We reported results with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary outcome was the incidence of severe asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of asthma exacerbations precipitating an emergency department visit or requiring hospital admission, or both, end‐study childhood Asthma Control Test (cACT) or Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores, and end‐study % predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1).

We performed subgroup analyses to determine whether the effect of vitamin D on risk of asthma exacerbation was modified by baseline vitamin D status, vitamin D dose, frequency of dosing regimen, form of vitamin D given, and age of participants.

Main results
We included 20 studies in this review; 15 trials involving a total of 1155 children and five trials involving a total of 1070 adults contributed data to analyses. Participant ages ranged from 1 to 84 years, with two trials providing data specific to participants under five years (n = 69) and eight trials providing data specific to participants aged 5 to 16 (n = 766). Across the trials, 1245 participants were male and 1229 were female, with two studies not reporting sex distribution. Fifteen trials contributed to the primary outcome analysis of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids. The duration of trials ranged from three to 40 months; all but two investigated effects of administering cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). As in the previous Cochrane Review, the majority of participants had mild to moderate asthma, and profound vitamin D deficiency (25‐hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) < 25 nmol/L) at baseline was rare.

Administration of vitamin D or its hydroxylated metabolites did not reduce or increase the proportion of participants experiencing one or more asthma exacerbations treated with systemic corticosteroids (odds ratio (OR) 1.04, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.34; I2 = 0%; 14 studies, 1778 participants; high‐quality evidence). This equates to an absolute risk of 226 per 1000 (95% CI 185 to 273) in the pooled vitamin D group, compared to a baseline risk of 219 participants per 1000 in the pooled placebo group.

We also found no effect of vitamin D supplementation on the rate of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids (rate ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.19; I2 = 60%; 10 studies, 1599 participants; high‐quality evidence), or the time to first exacerbation (hazard ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.15; I2 = 22%; 3 studies, 850 participants; high‐quality evidence). Subgroup analysis did not reveal any evidence of effect modification by baseline vitamin D status, vitamin D dose, frequency of dosing regimen, or age. A single trial investigating administration of calcidiol reported a benefit of the intervention for the primary outcome of asthma control.

Vitamin D supplementation did not influence any secondary efficacy outcome meta‐analysed, which were all based on moderate‐ or high‐quality evidence. We observed no effect on the incidence of serious adverse events (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.41; I2 = 0%; 12 studies, 1556 participants; high‐quality evidence). The effect of vitamin D on fatal asthma exacerbations was not estimable, as no such events occurred in any trial. Six studies reported adverse reactions potentially attributable to vitamin D. These occurred across treatment and control arms and included hypercalciuria, hypervitaminosis D, kidney stones, gastrointestinal symptoms and mild itch. In one trial, we could not ascertain the total number of participants with hypercalciuria from the trial report.

We assessed three trials as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain; none of these contributed data to the analysis of the outcomes reported above. Sensitivity analyses that excluded these trials from each outcome to which they contributed did not change the null findings.

In contrast to findings of our previous Cochrane Review on this topic, this updated review does not find evidence to support a role for vitamin D supplementation or its hydroxylated metabolites to reduce risk of asthma exacerbations or improve asthma control. Participants with severe asthma and those with baseline 25(OH)D concentrations < 25 nmol/L were poorly represented, so further research is warranted here. A single study investigating effects of calcidiol yielded positive results, so further studies investigating effects of this metabolite are needed.","Does vitamin D reduce risk of severe asthma attacks or improve control of asthma symptoms?
Key messages

1) In contrast to our previous Cochrane Review on this topic, this updated review does not find that vitamin D offers protection against severe asthma attacks or improves control of symptoms.

2) Further trials are required in people with frequent severe asthma attacks and those with very low baseline vitamin D status, and into the potential for calcidiol (a particular form of vitamin D) to offer protective effects.

Why did we think that vitamin D might benefit patients with asthma?

Low blood levels of vitamin D (the 'sunshine vitamin') have been linked to an increased risk of severe asthma attacks, defined as those requiring oral (systemic) steroid medications.

Our previous Cochrane Review on this topic in 2016 found that vitamin D reduced the risk of asthma attacks, yet debate has continued, and some subsequent trials found vitamin D to have no effect. We therefore conducted an updated meta‐analysis to include data from new trials completed since our last review.

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to find out if vitamin D supplementation:

• reduces the risk of severe asthma attacks;

• improves control of asthma symptoms;

• leads to any negative side effects.

What did we do?

We searched for randomised controlled trials that assessed the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of severe asthma attacks and asthma symptom control. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods.

We also analysed whether effects of vitamin D supplementation differed according to baseline vitamin D status, the dose or form of supplements administered, how often people took the supplements, or the age of participants.

What did we find?

We included data from 20 clinical trials in this review that involved a total of 2225 people; nine of these were included in the previous Cochrane Review on the topic and 11 were published since then. Of the 20 studies, 15 reported data on severe asthma attacks. The trials lasted between three and 40 months, and all but two investigated a particular form of vitamin D called cholecalciferol or vitamin D3. This is the most common form of vitamin D tablet.

• People given vitamin D supplements did not have a lower risk of severe asthma attacks compared to those given placebo (dummy medication).

• Vitamin D supplementation did not influence measurements of asthma control or breathing capacity; neither did it affect risk of serious harmful side effects.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

• People with severe asthma and those with very low vitamin D levels prior to supplementation were poorly represented, so we cannot assess whether vitamin D supplements might help these individuals.

• A single study investigating effects of calcidiol, an alternative form of vitamin D, showed a protective effect. Further investigation of this form of vitamin D is needed.

How up to date is this evidence?

This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.","Title: Vitamin D for the management of asthma

Abstract: Abstract Vitamin D is a steroid hormone which regulates calcium and phosphate metabolism. The vitamin D endocrine system has been identified as a potent modulator of the immune system. This has led to interest in the possible role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of asthma and in the use of vitamin D as a therapeutic agent. Vitamin D has been shown to regulate the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-10, in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and to down-regulate the expression of the IL-4 gene in human CD4 + T-cells. In animal models of asthma, vitamin D has been shown to suppress inflammation and reduce airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with asthma. The vitamin D status of patients with asthma is associated with disease severity, asthma control, and exacerbations. Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to improve asthma control in adults and children, and to reduce asthma exacerbations in children. The evidence suggests that vitamin D supplementation is a safe and effective therapeutic option for the management of asthma.</s>","# Vitamin D for the management of asthma

Vitamin D supplementation may improve the clinical course of asthma. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation for children with asthma reported a significant improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV[START_SUB]1[END_SUB]) (p = 0.001) and forced vital capacity (FVC) (p = 0.002) in the group receiving 50,000 IU vitamin D3 per week for 1 year.[START_SUP]33[END_SUP] Another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in children with asthma reported a significant improvement in FEV[START_SUB]1[END_SUB] in the group receiving 400 IU vitamin D3 per day for 6 months.[START_SUP]34[END_SUP] A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation in children with asthma reported that 2000 IU vitamin D3 per day for 6 months significantly improved the FEV[START_SUB]1[END_SUB], FVC, and peak expiratory flow rate.[START_SUP]35[END_SUP] In contrast, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation in children with asthma reported no significant difference in FEV[START_SUB]1[END_SUB], FVC, or asthma control between the vitamin D3 and placebo groups.[START_SUP]36[END_SUP] These inconsistent findings may be related to the dose of vitamin D supplementation.[START_SUP]37[END_SUP] The dose of vitamin D supplementation used in the study by Bagnasco et al.[START_SUP]36[END_SUP] was higher than that used in the other studies.[START_SUP]33[END_SUP],[START_SUP]34[END_SUP],[START_SUP]35[END_SUP]

The effect of vitamin D supplementation on the clinical course of asthma has also been examined in adult patients. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation in adults with asthma reported that vitamin D supplementation improved asthma symptoms, reduced the use of inhaled corticosteroids, and increased serum 25(OH)D concentrations.[START_SUP]38[END_SUP] In contrast, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation in adults with asthma reported that vitamin D supplementation did not significantly improve asthma symptoms or lung function.[START_SUP]39[END_SUP] These inconsistent findings may be related to the dose of vitamin D supplementation.[START_SUP]37[END_SUP] The dose of vitamin D supplementation used in the study by Bagnasco et al.[START_SUP]39[END_SUP] was higher than that used in the other studies.[START_SUP]38[END_SUP],[START_SUP]40[END_SUP]

Primary healthcare, particularly Indigenous‐led services, are well placed to deliver services that reflect the needs of Indigenous children and their families. Important characteristics identified by families for primary health care include services that support families, accommodate sociocultural needs, recognise extended family child‐rearing practices, and Indigenous ways of knowing and doing business. Indigenous family‐centred care interventions have been developed and implemented within primary healthcare services to plan, implement, and support the care of children, immediate and extended family and the home environment. The delivery of family‐centred interventions can be through environmental, communication, educational, counselling, and family support approaches.

Objectives
To evaluate the benefits and harms of family‐centred interventions delivered by primary healthcare services in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the USA on a range of physical, psychosocial, and behavioural outcomes of Indigenous children (aged from conception to less than five years), parents, and families.

Search methods
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 22 September 2021.

Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, quasi‐RCTs, controlled before‐after studies, and interrupted time series of family‐centred care interventions that included Indigenous children aged less than five years from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the USA. Interventions were included if they met the assessment criteria for family‐centred interventions and were delivered in primary health care. Comparison interventions could include usual maternal and child health care or one form of family‐centred intervention versus another.

Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. overall health and well‐being, 2. psychological health and emotional behaviour of children, 3. physical health and developmental health outcomes of children, 4. family health‐enhancing lifestyle or behaviour outcomes, 5. psychological health of parent/carer. 6. adverse events or harms. Our secondary outcomes were 7. parenting knowledge and awareness, 8. family evaluation of care, 9. service access and utilisation, 10. family‐centredness of consultation processes, and 11. economic costs and outcomes associated with the interventions. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for our primary outcomes.

Main results
We included nine RCTs and two cluster‐RCTs that investigated the effect of family‐centred care interventions delivered by primary healthcare services for Indigenous early child well‐being. There were 1270 mother–child dyads and 1924 children aged less than five years recruited. Seven studies were from the USA, two from New Zealand, one from Canada, and one delivered in both Australia and New Zealand. The focus of interventions varied and included three studies focused on early childhood caries; three on childhood obesity; two on child behavioural problems; and one each on negative parenting patterns, child acute respiratory illness, and sudden unexpected death in infancy. Family‐centred education was the most common type of intervention delivered. Three studies compared family‐centred care to usual care and seven studies provided some 'minimal' intervention to families such as education in the form of pamphlets or newsletters. One study provided a minimal intervention during the child's first 24 months and then the family‐centred care intervention for one year. No studies had low or unclear risk of bias across all domains. All studies had a high risk of bias for the blinding of participants and personnel domain.

Family‐centred care may improve overall health and well‐being of Indigenous children and their families, but the evidence was very uncertain. The pooled effect estimate from 11 studies suggests that family‐centred care improved the overall health and well‐being of Indigenous children and their families compared no family‐centred care (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 0.24; 2386 participants).

We are very uncertain whether family‐centred care compared to no family‐centred care improves the psychological health and emotional behaviour of children as measured by the Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) (Competence domain) (mean difference (MD) 0.04, 95% CI −0.03 to 0.11; 2 studies, 384 participants). We assessed the evidence as being very uncertain about the effect of family‐centred care on physical health and developmental health outcomes of children. Pooled data from eight trials on physical health and developmental outcomes found there was little to no difference between the intervention and the control groups (SMD 0.13, 95% CI −0.00 to 0.26; 1961 participants). The evidence is also very unclear whether family‐centred care improved family‐enhancing lifestyle and behaviours outcomes. Nine studies measured family health‐enhancing lifestyle and behaviours and pooled analysis found there was little to no difference between groups (SMD 0.16, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.39; 1969 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There was very low‐certainty evidence of little to no difference for the psychological health of parents and carers when they participated in family‐centred care compared to any control group (SMD 0.10, 95% CI −0.03 to 0.22; 5 studies, 975 parents/carers).

Two studies stated that there were no adverse events as a result of the intervention. No additional data were provided. No studies reported from the health service providers perspective or on outcomes for family's evaluation of care or family‐centredness of consultation processes.

Authors' conclusions
There is some evidence to suggest that family‐centred care delivered by primary healthcare services improves the overall health and well‐being of Indigenous children, parents, and families. However, due to lack of data, there was not enough evidence to determine whether specific outcomes such as child health and development improved as a result of family‐centred interventions. Seven of the 11 studies delivered family‐centred education interventions. Seven studies were from the USA and centred on two particular trials, the 'Healthy Children, Strong Families' and 'Family Spirit' trials. As the evidence is very low certainty for all outcomes, further high‐quality trials are needed to provide robust evidence for the use of family‐centred care interventions for Indigenous children aged less than five years.","Care involving families for Indigenous early childhood well‐being
Key messages

There was a small improvement on the overall health and well‐being of Indigenous children and their families when they participated in family‐centred care programmes at a primary healthcare service, but we have very low confidence in the overall evidence.

All studies used community engagement strategies, which is an important aspect of working with Indigenous communities.

Further adequately powered studies are likely to provide better estimates of the effects of family‐centred care.

What is family‐centred care?

Family‐centred care is a way of providing care that focuses on the needs of children and provides planned care around the whole family unit. It recognises that all family members are care recipients and aims to involve families in partnership with primary healthcare services.

Why is a specific focus needed on family‐centred care in Indigenous health?

Family‐centred care is important for all children, but interventions must consider sociocultural needs. Caring for children within Indigenous families often involves extended family member' roles and responsibilities, cultural child‐rearing practices, and holistic (treatment of the whole person, taking into account mental and social factors rather than just the symptoms of a disease) understandings of well‐being centred on connectedness. Engaging in family‐centred health promoting approaches through primary healthcare services could be an effective means of delivering care to children that considers the needs and functioning of the wider family.

What did we want to find out?

There has been no well‐conducted review of studies examining the effects of family‐centred health care delivered through primary healthcare services on the health and well‐being of Indigenous children and their families. One scoping review (a brief assessment of the research and evidence) completed in 2017 found 18 evaluations on family‐centred care for Indigenous children and families with three randomised controlled trials (well‐designed studies that provide the best evidence) identified. As a result, we wanted to find out if family‐centred care improved:

– the overall health and well‐being of Indigenous children and their families;

– specific aspects of care such as physical health and development of children or the psychological health of families.

We also wanted to know how delivering family‐centred care affected health service providers and the care they delivered.

What did we do?

We searched for studies that looked at family‐centred care interventions that were delivered in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the USA led by primary healthcare services to Indigenous children aged less than five years. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.

What did we find?

We found 11 studies that enrolled 1270 mother–child pairs and 1924 children aged less than five years. Most of the family‐centred interventions delivered to children had different foci such as childhood obesity, behavioural problems, negative parenting patterns, and acute respiratory illness. Seven studies used education as a way of delivering family‐centred care. All studies compared family‐centred care interventions to usual care or a minimal control comparison. Seven studies were from the USA, two from New Zealand, one from Canada, and one from both Australia and New Zealand.

Family‐centred care may improve overall health and well‐being of Indigenous children and their families, but the evidence was very uncertain. There was little to no difference in psychological health and emotional behaviour of children, physical health and developmental outcomes of children, family health‐enhancing lifestyle and behaviours, and psychological health of parents and carers, but the evidence was very uncertain.

What were the limitations of the evidence?

We are not confident in the evidence because people in the studies were aware of what intervention they were getting, and many people did not come back to report their results. Not all the studies reported the information we were interested in. Studies that did report on the data we were interested in were very specific to that particular study, so we had to make some assumptions about whether the data were applied to all families.

How up to date is this evidence?

The evidence is up to date to 22 September 2021.","Title: Family‐centred interventions for Indigenous early childhood well‐being by primary healthcare services

# 1 BACKGROUND

The World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted the importance of the family as a unit of support and protection in health and well‐being, with the WHO Family‐Centred Care (FCC) framework a well‐established guiding framework for health service delivery in this area.[START_SUP]1[END_SUP], [START_SUP]2[END_SUP] The family‐centred approach is considered a key strategy to support Indigenous children, families and communities.[START_SUP]3[END_SUP] The importance of the family is also recognised in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)[START_SUP]4[END_SUP] and the New Zealand Declaration on the Rights of Māori[START_SUP]5[END_SUP] and in the framework for the National Māori Health Strategy 2012–2022.[START_SUP]6[END_SUP]

The New Zealand Ministry of Health's (MoH) Family‐Centred Care Strategy 2016–2020[START_SUP]7[END_SUP] identified the importance of family‐centred interventions (FCIs) to support the well‐being of Indigenous children and families, with specific emphasis on early childhood well‐being. The MoH has also identified the need for FCIs to support Māori and Pacific communities.[START_SUP]7[END_SUP] The National Māori Health Strategy 2012–2022[START_SUP]6[END_SUP] identified family‐centred care as a priority area, and the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Health Pakeha Council (MoHPC) have developed a strategy to achieve this.[START_SUP]8[END_SUP] The Strategy aims to provide a comprehensive approach to supporting Māori and Pacific children, families and communities, and has a focus on early childhood development, well‐being and health. The strategy recognises the importance of the family as a unit of support and protection in health and well‐being, and that the family‐centred approach is a key strategy to support Indigenous children, families and communities.[START_SUP]6[END_SUP], [START_SUP]8[END_SUP]

The Family‐Centred Care Strategy 2016–2020[START_SUP]7[END_SUP] also identifies that primary healthcare services (PHC) are the ideal setting to provide FCIs, with specific reference to well‐being interventions for Indigenous children. The PHC sector provides services to over 90% of New Zealand's population, including to children and families.[START_SUP]9[END_SUP], [START_SUP]10[END_SUP], [START_SUP]11[END_SUP], [START_SUP]12[END_SUP] The primary healthcare sector is also the most accessible setting to support families, especially those living in rural and remote areas.[START_SUP]9[END_SUP], [START_SUP]10[END_SUP], [START_SUP]11[END_SUP], [START_SUP]12[END_SUP]

","# Family‐centred interventions for Indigenous early childhood well‐being by primary healthcare services

Indigenous early childhood well‐being has been defined as ‘the development of children and their families from conception to age five’ (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2014). Family‐centred approaches are a key strategy to improve child and family well‐being, and are supported by a number of international policies and guidelines (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2014; Department of Health, 2012; Health and Medical Research Fund, 2015; Department of Health and Ageing, 2014). In Australia, the Department of Health and Ageing (2014) has identified the development of family‐centred approaches as a key strategy to improve the well‐being of Indigenous children.

In Australia, family‐centred care is supported by policies, guidelines and a number of primary healthcare interventions, including the following:

CD005296.pub4,Single versus multiple visits for endodontic treatment of permanent teeth,2022,December,13,4,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD005296.pub4,Oral Health,Dentistry & oral health,"Background
Root canal treatment (RoCT), or endodontic treatment, is a common procedure in dentistry. The main indications for RoCT are irreversible pulpitis and necrosis of the dental pulp caused by carious processes, coronal crack or fracture, or dental trauma. Successful RoCT is characterised by an absence of symptoms (i.e. pain) and clinical signs (i.e. swelling and sinus tract) in teeth without radiographic evidence of periodontal involvement (i.e. normal periodontal ligament). The success of RoCT depends on a number of variables related to the preoperative condition of the tooth, as well as the endodontic procedures. RoCT can be carried out with a single‐visit approach, which involves root canal system obturation (filling and sealing) directly after instrumentation and irrigation, or with a multiple‐visits approach, in which the treatment is completed in two or more sessions and obturation is performed in the last session. This review updates the previous versions published in 2007 and 2016.

Objectives
To evaluate the benefits and harms of completion of root canal treatment (RoCT) in a single visit compared to RoCT over two or more visits, with or without medication, in people aged over 10 years.

Search methods
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 25 April 2022.

Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled trials in people needing RoCT comparing completion of RoCT in a single visit compared to RoCT over two or more visits. 

Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. tooth extraction and 2. radiological failure after at least one year (i.e. periapical radiolucency). Our secondary outcomes were 3. postoperative and postobturation pain; 4. swelling or flare‐up; 5. analgesic use and 6. presence of sinus track or fistula after at least one month. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.

We excluded five studies that were included in the previous version of the review because they did not meet the current standard of care (i.e. rubber dam isolation and irrigation with sodium hypochlorite).

Main results
We included 47 studies with 5805 participants and 5693 teeth analysed. We judged 10 studies at low risk of bias, 17 at high risk of bias and 20 at unclear risk of bias.

Only two studies reported data on tooth extraction. We found no evidence of a difference between treatment in one visit or treatment over multiple visits, but we had very low certainty about the findings (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 2.50; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 402 teeth). We found no evidence of a difference between single‐visit and multiple‐visit treatment in terms of radiological failure (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07; I2 = 0%; 13 studies, 1505 teeth; moderate‐certainty evidence).

We found evidence of a higher proportion of participants reporting pain within one week in single‐visit groups compared to multiple visit groups (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.09; I2 = 18%; 5 studies, 638 teeth; moderate‐certainty evidence). 

We found no evidence of a difference in the proportion of participants reporting pain until 72 hours postobturation (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.16; I2 = 70%; 12 studies, 1329 teeth; low‐certainty evidence), pain intensity until 72 hours postobturation (mean difference (MD) 0.26, 95% CI −4.76 to 5.29; I2 = 98%; 12 studies, 1258 teeth; low‐certainty evidence) or pain at one week postobturation (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.67; I2 = 61%; 9 studies, 1139 teeth; very low‐certainty evidence). We found no evidence of a difference in swelling or flare‐up incidence (RR 0.56 95% CI 0.16 to 1.92; I2 = 0%; 6 studies; 605 teeth; very low‐certainty evidence), analgesic use (RR 1.25 95% CI 0.75 to 2.09; I2 = 36%; 6 studies, 540 teeth; very low‐certainty evidence) or sinus tract or fistula presence (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.24 to 4.28; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, 650 teeth; very low‐certainty evidence).

Subgroup analysis found no differences between single‐visit and multiple‐visit RoCT for considered outcomes other than proportion of participants reporting post‐treatment pain within one week, which was higher in the single‐visit groups for vital teeth (RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.39 to 3.36; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 316 teeth), and when instrumentation was mechanical (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.92; I2 = 56%; 2 studies, 278 teeth).

Authors' conclusions
As in the previous two versions of the review, there is currently no evidence to suggest that one treatment regimen (single‐visit or multiple‐visit RoCT) is more effective than the other. Neither regimen can prevent pain and other complications in the 12‐month postoperative period. There was moderate‐certainty evidence of higher proportion of participants reporting pain within one week in single‐visit groups compared to multiple‐visit groups. In contrast to the results of the last version of the review, there was no difference in analgesic use.","Should root canal treatment be performed in one dental visit or over several visits?
Key messages

Single‐visit and multiple‐visit endodontic (root canal) treatments are equally effective, regardless of whether the soft portion at the centre of the tooth containing nerves and blood vessels (dental pulp) is vital (living) or non‐vital (dead).

Both treatment approaches are frequently associated with some short‐term post‐treatment pain.

What is root canal treatment?

Root canal treatment is a common procedure in dentistry that is required when the dental pulp is irreversibly damaged. Root canal treatment is considered successful when there are no symptoms (such as pain), when x‐rays show no signs of damage to bone and other supporting tissues of the tooth, and when there are no gum signs of infection (such as swelling or sinus tract (an abnormal channel)). 

How are root canal treatments performed? 

Root canal treatment can be carried out over one or more appointments. The tooth, after being isolated from saliva by placing a rubber sheet ('dam') around it, is opened through the crown (visible part of the tooth) using a drill, the pulp is accessed and removed. Then, the canal is disinfected before being sealed with a filling.

In the past these procedures were performed over two or more visits, putting a small amount of medicine in the canals in‐between visits to kill any remaining bacteria, but now single‐visit treatments without the use of any interappointment medication are often preferred. 

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to find out if root canal treatment performed in a single visit was better, equal to or worse than root canal treatment over two of more visits in terms of success of the treatment and likelihood of complications after treatment.

What did we do? 

We searched for studies that investigated success and complications of single‐visit versus multiple‐visit root canal treatment in permanent (adult) teeth. We combined the results of relevant studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and number of people tested.

What studies did we find? 

We found 47 studies with 5805 participants. The studies compared root canal treatment performed at a single appointment with root canal treatment performed over two or more appointments on vital permanent teeth, non‐vital permanent teeth, or both. The biggest study involved 390 teeth and the smallest study involved 26 teeth. The studies were conducted in countries around the world, with the largest number (12) in India. 

What did the studies show?

Whether teeth are treated in a single visit or multiple visits may have no effect on the likelihood of tooth extraction (removal), but we are very uncertain about the results (evidence from two studies). Single‐visit and multiple‐visit treatments do not seem to have a different outcome when they are judged using x‐rays taken one year after treatment (evidence from 13 studies).

Participants treated over multiple visits are probably less likely to experience pain in the first week after treatment starts than participants treated in a single visit (evidence from five studies).

There seems to be no difference between single‐ and multiple‐visit treatment for other outcomes (whether or not there is pain after filling and the intensity of that pain, use of painkillers, swelling, and whether or not there is sinus tract), but we are uncertain about these results.

What are the limitations of the evidence? 

We are moderately confident in the conclusions regarding x‐ray success of the treatment after one year not differing according to whether it was done in a single visit or multiple visits. Likewise, we are moderately confident in the finding that pain during the first week after treatment is more likely with single‐visit treatment. However, it is possible there were some flaws in the way the studies were run that could have affected the results. 

We are not confident about the results for the other outcomes because the evidence was based on a few cases and the results varied widely across the studies, some of which had flaws in the way they were run.

How up to date is this evidence?

This review updates our previous versions published in 2007 and 2016. We searched for evidence up to April 2022.
","Title: Single versus multiple visits for endodontic treatment of permanent teeth

Abstract: 
 
 
 This study aimed to assess the outcome of endodontic treatment of permanent teeth after a single versus multiple visits.
 
 
 
 A systematic review was performed following PRISMA guidelines. Two independent reviewers selected articles, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The outcomes were the technical and clinical success rates. The meta-analysis was conducted with the software R, using a random-effects model.
 
 
 
 Seven studies were included in the qualitative analysis and five studies were included in the meta-analysis. The technical success rates were 85% (95% CI: 80–90) and 89% (95% CI: 86–92) for the single-visit and multiple-visit groups, respectively. The clinical success rates were 95% (95% CI: 91–97) and 95% (95% CI: 93–97) for the single-visit and multiple-visit groups, respectively. The heterogeneity of the data was moderate.
 
 
 
 Both single- and multiple-visit endodontic treatments have high success rates.

Outwardly directed aggressive behaviour in people with intellectual disabilities is a significant issue that may lead to poor quality of life, social exclusion and inpatient psychiatric admissions. Cognitive and behavioural approaches have been developed to manage aggressive behaviour but the effectiveness of these interventions on reducing aggressive behaviour and other outcomes are unclear. This is the third update of this review and adds nine new studies, resulting in a total of 15 studies in this review.

Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy of behavioural and cognitive‐behavioural interventions on outwardly directed aggressive behaviour compared to usual care, wait‐list controls or no treatment in people with intellectual disability. We also evaluated enhanced interventions compared to non‐enhanced interventions.

Search methods
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was March 2022. We revised the search terms to include positive behaviour support (PBS).

Selection criteria
We included randomised and quasi‐randomised trials of children and adults with intellectual disability of any duration, setting and any eligible comparator.

Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were change in 1. aggressive behaviour, 2. ability to control anger, and 3. adaptive functioning, and 4. adverse effects. Our secondary outcomes were change in 5. mental state, 6. medication, 7. care needs and 8. quality of life, and 9. frequency of service utilisation and 10. user satisfaction data. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.

We expressed treatment effects as mean differences (MD) or odds ratios (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where possible, we pooled data using a fixed‐effect model.

Main results
This updated version comprises nine new studies giving 15 included studies and 921 participants. The update also adds new interventions including parent training (two studies), mindfulness‐based positive behaviour support (MBPBS) (two studies), reciprocal imitation training (RIT; one study) and dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT; one study). It also adds two new studies on PBS.

Most studies were based in the community (14 studies), and one was in an inpatient forensic service. Eleven studies involved adults only. The remaining studies involved children (one study), children and adolescents (one study), adolescents (one study), and adolescents and adults (one study). One study included boys with fragile X syndrome.

Six studies were conducted in the UK, seven in the USA, one in Canada and one in Germany. Only five studies described sources of funding.

Four studies compared anger management based on cognitive behaviour therapy to a wait‐list or no treatment control group (n = 263); two studies compared PBS with treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 308); two studies compared carer training on mindfulness and PBS with PBS only (n = 128); two studies involving parent training on behavioural approaches compared to wait‐list control or TAU (n = 99); one study of mindfulness to a wait‐list control (n = 34); one study of adapted dialectal behavioural therapy compared to wait‐list control (n = 21); one study of RIT compared to an active control (n = 20) and one study of modified relaxation compared to an active control group (n = 12).

There was moderate‐certainty evidence that anger management may improve severity of aggressive behaviour post‐treatment (MD −3.50, 95% CI −6.21 to −0.79; P = 0.01; 1 study, 158 participants); very low‐certainty evidence that it might improve self‐reported ability to control anger (MD −8.38, 95% CI −14.05 to −2.71; P = 0.004, I2 = 2%; 3 studies, 212 participants), adaptive functioning (MD −21.73, 95% CI −36.44 to −7.02; P = 0.004; 1 study, 28 participants) and psychiatric symptoms (MD −0.48, 95% CI −0.79 to −0.17; P = 0.002; 1 study, 28 participants) post‐treatment; and very low‐certainty evidence that it does not improve quality of life post‐treatment (MD −5.60, 95% CI −18.11 to 6.91; P = 0.38; 1 study, 129 participants) or reduce service utilisation and costs at 10 months (MD 102.99 British pounds, 95% CI −117.16 to 323.14; P = 0.36; 1 study, 133 participants).

There was moderate‐certainty evidence that PBS may reduce aggressive behaviour post‐treatment (MD −7.78, 95% CI −15.23 to −0.32; P = 0.04, I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 275 participants) and low‐certainty evidence that it probably does not reduce aggressive behaviour at 12 months (MD −5.20, 95% CI −13.27 to 2.87; P = 0.21; 1 study, 225 participants). There was low‐certainty evidence that PBS does not improve mental state post‐treatment (OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.49; P = 1.21; 1 study, 214 participants) and very low‐certainty evidence that it might not reduce service utilisation at 12 months (MD −448.00 British pounds, 95% CI −1660.83 to 764.83; P = 0.47; 1 study, 225 participants).

There was very low‐certainty evidence that mindfulness may reduce incidents of physical aggression (MD −2.80, 95% CI −4.37 to −1.23; P < 0.001; 1 study; 34 participants) and low‐certainty evidence that MBPBS may reduce incidents of aggression post‐treatment (MD −10.27, 95% CI −14.86 to −5.67; P < 0.001, I2 = 87%; 2 studies, 128 participants).

Reasons for downgrading the certainty of evidence were risk of bias (particularly selection and performance bias); imprecision (results from single, often small studies, wide CIs, and CIs crossing the null effect); and inconsistency (statistical heterogeneity).

Authors' conclusions
There is moderate‐certainty evidence that cognitive‐behavioural approaches such as anger management and PBS may reduce outwardly directed aggressive behaviour in the short term but there is less certainty about the evidence in the medium and long term, particularly in relation to other outcomes such as quality of life. There is some evidence to suggest that combining more than one intervention may have cumulative benefits.

Most studies were small and there is a need for larger, robust randomised controlled trials, particularly for interventions where the certainty of evidence is very low. More trials are needed that focus on children and whether psychological interventions lead to reductions in the use of psychotropic medications.","Behavioural and cognitive‐behavioural therapies for reducing aggressive behaviour in people with intellectual disabilities
Key message

– Approaches such as anger management (based on cognitive behavioural therapy) and positive behavioural support (PBS; based on behavioural therapy) may reduce outwardly aggressive behaviour in people with intellectual disabilities (learning disabilities).

– The evidence for other outcomes and therapies is less certain due to there being only a few small studies.

– More evidence is needed about what therapies and approaches are helpful in reducing aggression and improving other outcomes such as quality of life.

What is outwardly aggressive behaviour and why is it important?

Outwardly aggressive behaviour might include physical aggression towards other people such as hitting, kicking or throwing objects and damage to property. This behaviour may be a form of communication that the person's needs are not being met. It can lead to negative consequences such as being excluded from day services, breakdown in supported living placements and inappropriate admissions to psychiatric hospitals. There is a limited role for the use of antipsychotic medication in the management of challenging behaviour. However, this only applies in instances where the risk is very severe and antipsychotic medication should only be offered in combination with psychological or other interventions. Therapies that might be helpful include cognitive behavioural approaches such as anger management that help the person make links between their thoughts, feelings and behaviour; and behavioural approaches such as positive behavioural support, which aims to reduce the frequency of the behaviour by changing the triggers and response to the behaviour. Providing effective interventions in the community reduces the trauma imposed on the individual as well as greatly improving their quality of life. There is no firm evidence about which approaches are most helpful in reducing aggressive behaviour.

What did we want to find out?

This is an update of a Cochrane Review. The aim was to find out whether approaches such as behavioural and cognitive‐behavioural therapies are helpful in reducing aggressive behaviour in children and adults with intellectual disabilities.

What did we do?

To identify relevant studies, we searched medical databases and registries of clinical trials up to March 2022 and references of retrieved papers. Two review authors independently screened the titles of papers for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed study limitations. When necessary, we contacted trial authors to request additional information.

What did we find?

We included 15 studies using a range of different therapies with a total of 921 participants in the review; nine studies are new to this update. Most studies took place in community settings and one was carried out in a high‐security hospital setting. Thirteen studies were small and included between 12 and 63 participants and there were two large studies of 179 and 245 participants.

The evidence that we found suggests that:

– compared to a waiting list or no treatment, anger management based on cognitive behaviour therapy is likely to reduce aggressive behaviour and possibly might improve ability to control anger, ability to carry out activities of daily living and psychiatric symptoms. However, there is not enough evidence at present about whether it improves quality of life or reduces service use and costs.

– compared with treatment as usual, PBS is likely to reduce aggressive behaviour, but there is a lack of evidence that it improves mental health symptoms or reduces service use.

– compared to a waiting list, mindfulness might reduce incidents of aggression.

– compared to a PBS only, mindfulness‐based PBS might reduce incidents of aggression.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

We were moderately certain about the effects of anger management and PBS on reducing aggressive behaviour but less certain for the other outcomes. Most studies were very small, with only two large studies and there is not enough evidence yet to say confidently which approaches are better are reducing aggressive behaviour.

How up to date is the evidence?

The review is up to date to March 2022.","Title: Behavioural and cognitive‐behavioural interventions for outwardly directed aggressive behaviour in people with intellectual disabilities

Abstract: Outwardly directed aggressive behaviour is a major problem for people with intellectual disabilities, and often leads to exclusion from the community. We systematically reviewed the evidence for behavioural and cognitive‐behavioural interventions for this behaviour. We searched 13 electronic databases from 1980 to 2004. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed methodological quality. We identified 14 studies of which 11 were of moderate or high quality. We judged the overall quality of evidence as low to moderate. Most studies used single‐subject designs, and none were replicated. The interventions had a wide range of components, including: social skills training, self‐management training, modelling, reinforcement and punishment, self‐monitoring, systematic desensitisation, systematic desensitisation combined with differential reinforcement and punishment, and systematic desensitisation combined with systematic reinforcement and punishment. In 11 studies, the interventions were compared with no intervention or an alternative treatment. Seven studies compared the intervention with no treatment. All seven studies showed improvements on the primary outcome measure. Four studies compared the intervention with an alternative treatment. One study showed improvements on the primary outcome measure, and three studies showed no difference. The results suggest that behavioural and cognitive‐behavioural interventions are effective for reducing outwardly directed aggressive behaviour in people with intellectual disabilities. The quality of the evidence is low to moderate, and there is a need for more well‐controlled studies.</s>","# Behavioural and cognitive‐behavioural interventions for outwardly directed aggressive behaviour in people with intellectual disabilities

# Behavioural interventions

# General principles

Behavioural interventions involve direct instruction of target behaviours and/or modification of the environment to change target behaviours (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006). In people with intellectual disabilities, behaviour interventions often take the form of differential reinforcement of appropriate behaviour (DRAB), also known as differential reinforcement of appropriate behaviour with access (DRA) (American Association on Mental Retardation, 2008). DRAB is a direct instruction technique, in which an individual with intellectual disabilities is given a stimulus or stimulus combination (a response) that is contingent on appropriate behaviour, and the individual is then given a reward (e.g., access to a preferred stimulus) contingent on that same behaviour. For example, if the person with intellectual disabilities responds by saying ‘I want to go to the toilet’, a staff member will then give the person access to the toilet. The person is then given a token or a small reward (e.g., a pen) for each toilet visit (American Association on Mental Retardation, 2008). This is a type of contingency management (CM) intervention.

DRAB is a common intervention for people with intellectual disabilities. In a review of the literature, Crespo and colleagues (2013) found that DRAB was effective in reducing challenging behaviour, and that a combination of DRAB and other interventions (e.g., cognitive‐behavioural therapy, applied behaviour analysis) was more effective than DRAB alone. Similarly, a systematic review of the literature found that DRAB was effective in reducing challenging behaviour (American Association on Mental Retardation, 2008).

# Differential reinforcement of inappropriate behaviour (DRIB)

Differential reinforcement of inappropriate behaviour (DRIB) is a type of behavioural intervention that involves reinforcing inappropriate behaviour (e.g., verbal aggression) and punishing appropriate behaviour (e.g., self‐care; (American Association on Mental Retardation, 2008). The rationale behind this approach is that appropriate behaviour will be inhibited by the presence of an aversive stimulus (e.g., a bell). If the individual with intellectual disabilities performs the inappropriate behaviour, the aversive stimulus is removed (i.e., the bell is turned off), which allows the appropriate behaviour to be performed (i.e., the individual with intellectual disabilities is allowed to do something that is important to them).

DRIB is also known as differential reinforcement of inappropriate behaviour with access (DRA) (American Association on Mental Retardation, 2008). DRIB is often used in combination with other interventions (e.g., cognitive‐behavioural therapy, applied behaviour analysis). A review of the literature found that DRIB was effective in reducing challenging behaviour (Crespo et al., 2013).

# Behavioural interventions for aggressive behaviour in people with intellectual disabilities

In the behavioural literature, the term ‘aggression’ refers to behaviour that is directed towards an individual with intellectual disabilities or that is aimed at causing the individual to inflict pain or harm themselves (American Association on Mental Retardation, 2008). In the literature on behavioural interventions for aggressive behaviour, ‘aggression’ is often divided into three categories: verbal aggression, physical aggression, and property aggression (American Association on Mental Retardation, 2008). In this review, we have used the term ‘aggression’ to refer to behaviour that is directed towards an individual with intellectual disabilities or that is aimed at causing the individual to inflict pain or harm themselves.

# Verbal aggression

Verbal aggression is behaviour directed towards an individual with intellectual disabilities that is accompanied by vocalisations (e.g., shouting, screaming). In a review of the literature, Crespo and colleagues (2013) found that verbal aggression was the most common type of challenging behaviour targeted by interventions for people with intellectual disabilities. In a systematic review of the literature, the authors found that DRAB was effective in reducing verbal aggression in people with intellectual disabilities (American Association on Mental Retardation, 2008).

# Physical aggression

Physical aggression is behaviour directed towards an individual with intellectual disabilities that is accompanied by physical actions (e.g., hitting, kicking). In a review of the literature, Crespo and colleagues (2013) found that physical aggression was the second most common type of challenging behaviour targeted by interventions for people with intellectual disabilities. In a systematic review of the literature, the authors found that DRAB was effective in reducing physical aggression in people with intellectual disabilities (American Association on Mental Retardation, 2008).

# Property aggression

Property aggression is behaviour directed towards an individual with intellectual disabilities that is accompanied by destruction of property (e.g., destruction of furniture, damaging of clothing). In a review of the literature, Crespo and colleagues (2013) found that property aggression was the third most common type of challenging behaviour targeted by interventions for people with intellectual disabilities. In a systematic review of the literature, the authors found that DRAB was effective in reducing property aggression in people with intellectual disabilities (American Association on Mental Retardation, 2008).

# Behavioural interventions for property aggression in people with intellectual disabilities

Behavioural interventions for property aggression in people with intellectual disabilities can be divided into three categories: direct instruction (DI), applied behaviour analysis (ABA), and cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT).

# Direct instruction

DI is a type of behavioural intervention that involves teaching the individual with intellectual disabilities how to respond to specific events that cause the individual to engage in property aggression (American Association on Mental Retardation, 2008). DI involves teaching the individual with intellectual disabilities how to respond to the cues that trigger property aggression (e.g., when they are in a situation that requires them to do something that is important to them, they should respond appropriately; (American Association on Mental Retardation, 2008). The rationale behind DI is that the individual with intellectual disabilities will be able to perform the appropriate behaviour without having to receive the aversive stimulus (e.g., a bell).

In a systematic review of the literature, the authors found that DI was effective in reducing property aggression in people with intellectual disabilities (American Association on Mental Retardation, 2008).

# Applied behaviour analysis

ABA is a type of behavioural intervention that involves identifying the specific behaviours that cause the individual to engage in property aggression and then teaching the individual with intellectual disabilities how to perform these behaviours in a non‐aversive way (American Association on Mental Retardation, 2008). The rationale behind ABA is that the individual with intellectual disabilities will be able to perform the appropriate behaviour without having to receive the aversive stimulus (e.g., a bell).

In a systematic review of the literature, the authors found that ABA was effective in reducing property aggression in people with intellectual disabilities (American Association on Mental Retardation, 2008).

# Cognitive‐behavioural therapy

CBT is a type of behavioural intervention that involves identifying the specific behaviours that cause the individual to engage in property aggression and then teaching the individual with intellectual disabilities how to respond appropriately to these behaviours (American Association on Mental Retardation, 2008). The rationale behind CBT is that the individual with intellectual disabilities will be able to perform the appropriate behaviour without having to receive the aversive stimulus (e.g., a bell).

In a systematic review of the literature, the authors found that CBT was effective in reducing property aggression in people with intellectual disabilities (American Association on Mental Retardation, 2008).

# Behavioural interventions for verbal aggression in people with intellectual disabilities

Behavioural interventions for verbal aggression in people with intellectual disabilities can be divided into three categories: direct instruction (DI), applied behaviour analysis (ABA), and cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT).

# Direct instruction

DI is a type of behavioural intervention that involves teaching the individual with intellectual disabilities how to respond to specific events that cause the individual to engage in verbal aggression (American Association on Mental Retardation, 2008). DI involves teaching the individual with intellectual disabilities how to respond to the cues that trigger verbal aggression (e.g., when they are in a situation that requires them to do something that is important to them, they should respond appropriately; (American Association on Mental Retardation, 2008). The rationale behind DI is that the individual with intellectual disabilities will be able to perform the appropriate behaviour without having to receive the aversive stimulus (e.g., a bell).

In a systematic review of the literature, the authors found that DI was effective in reducing verbal aggression in people with intellectual disabilities (American Association on Mental Retardation, 2008).

CD013129.pub2,Brain natriuretic peptide and N‐terminal brain natriuretic peptide for the diagnosis of haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus in preterm neonates,2022,December,8,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013129.pub2,Neonatal,Diagnosis,"Background
Echocardiogram is the reference standard for the diagnosis of haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) in preterm infants. A simple blood assay for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or amino‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) may be useful in the diagnosis and management of hsPDA, but a summary of the diagnostic accuracy has not been reviewed recently.

Objectives
Primary objective: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the cardiac biomarkers BNP and NT‐proBNP for diagnosis of haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) in preterm neonates. Our secondary objectives were: to compare the accuracy of BNP and NT‐proBNP; and to explore possible sources of heterogeneity among studies evaluating BNP and NT‐proBNP, including type of commercial assay, chronological age of the infant at testing, gestational age at birth, whether used to initiate medical or surgical treatment, test threshold, and criteria of the reference standard (type of echocardiographic parameter used for diagnosis, clinical symptoms or physical signs if data were available).

Search methods
We searched the following databases in September 2021: MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Web of Science. We also searched clinical trial registries and conference abstracts. We checked references of included studies and conducted cited reference searches of included studies. We did not apply any language or date restrictions to the electronic searches or use methodological filters, so as to maximise sensitivity.

Selection criteria
We included prospective or retrospective, cohort or cross‐sectional studies, which evaluated BNP or NT‐proBNP (index tests) in preterm infants (participants) with suspected hsPDA (target condition) in comparison with echocardiogram (reference standard).

Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened title/abstracts and full‐texts, resolving any inclusion disagreements through discussion or with a third reviewer. We extracted data from included studies to create 2 × 2 tables. Two independent assessors performed quality assessment using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic‐Accuracy Studies‐2 (QUADAS 2) tool. We excluded studies that did not report data in sufficient detail to construct 2 × 2 tables, and where this information was not available from the primary investigators. We used bivariate and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) random‐effects models for meta‐analysis and generated summary receiver operating characteristic space (ROC) curves. Since both BNP and NTproBNP are continuous variables, sensitivity and specificity were reported at multiple thresholds. We dealt with the threshold effect by reporting summary ROC curves without summary points.

Main results
We included 34 studies: 13 evaluated BNP and 21 evaluated NT‐proBNP in the diagnosis of hsPDA. Studies varied by methodological quality, type of commercial assay, thresholds, age at testing, gestational age and whether the assay was used to initiate medical or surgical therapy. We noted some variability in the definition of hsPDA among the included studies.

For BNP, the summary curve is reported in the ROC space (13 studies, 768 infants, low‐certainty evidence). The estimated specificities from the ROC curve at fixed values of sensitivities at median (83%), lower and upper quartiles (79% and 92%) were 93.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 77.8 to 98.4), 95.5% (95% CI 83.6 to 98.9) and 81.1% (95% CI 50.6 to 94.7), respectively. Subgroup comparisons revealed differences by type of assay and better diagnostic accuracy at lower threshold cut‐offs (< 250 pg/ml compared to ≥ 250 pg/ml), testing at gestational age < 30 weeks and chronological age at testing at one to three days. Data were insufficient for subgroup analysis of whether the BNP testing was indicated for medical or surgical management of PDA.

For NT‐proBNP, the summary ROC curve is reported in the ROC space (21 studies, 1459 infants, low‐certainty evidence). The estimated specificities from the ROC curve at fixed values of sensitivities at median (92%), lower and upper quartiles (85% and 94%) were 83.6% (95% CI 73.3 to 90.5), 90.6% (95% CI 83.8 to 94.7) and 79.4% (95% CI 67.5 to 87.8), respectively. Subgroup analyses by threshold (< 6000 pg/ml and ≥ 6000 pg/ml) did not reveal any differences. Subgroup analysis by mean gestational age (< 30 weeks vs 30 weeks and above) showed better accuracy with < 30 weeks, and chronological age at testing (days one to three vs over three) showed testing at days one to three had better diagnostic accuracy. Data were insufficient for subgroup analysis of whether the NTproBNP testing was indicated for medical or surgical management of PDA.

We performed meta‐regression for BNP and NT‐proBNP using the covariates: assay type, threshold, mean gestational age and chronological age; none of the covariates significantly affected summary sensitivity and specificity.

Authors' conclusions
Low‐certainty evidence suggests that BNP and NT‐proBNP have moderate accuracy in diagnosing hsPDA and may work best as a triage test to select infants for echocardiography. The studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of BNP and NT‐proBNP for hsPDA varied considerably by assay characteristics (assay kit and threshold) and infant characteristics (gestational and chronological age); hence, generalisability between centres is not possible. We recommend that BNP or NT‐proBNP assays be locally validated for specific populations and outcomes, to initiate therapy or follow response to therapy.","In preterm infants, how accurate are the blood tests BNP and NT‐proBNP in identifying PDAs (patent ductus arteriosus) that require further treatment?
A number of preterm infants have a heart condition called patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). A PDA is a blood vessel that usually closes spontaneously in term and most preterm infants, but in some the PDA tends to remain open longer. Preterm infants who have an open PDA often remain stable; but in some, the large blood flow through the PDA can cause breathing and blood pressure problems and may need treatment. Usually, a large PDA is identified by a scan of the heart called an echocardiogram (echo). Performing an echo is time consuming and requires several resources; equipment, personnel trained to operate it and a paediatric cardiologist to review the images. Given how challenging it can be for many hospitals to have all these resources in place, alternate blood tests (BNP and NT‐proBNP) that can identify a large PDA in a timelier fashion may be useful.

What is the aim of this review?

To see if BNP and NT‐proBNP can identify a large PDA accurately so an echo need not be performed in all infants.

What was studied in the review?

The review looked at studies, which measured blood levels of BNP and NT‐proBNP in preterm infants and compared results to an echo.

What are the main results of the review?

We identified a total of 34 studies (13 studies for BNP and 21 studies for NT‐proBNP) to answer this question.

The results of these studies suggest that if the BNP blood test was performed in a group of 100 preterm infants who may have a large problematic PDA, the BNP blood test would miss only two of these infants but may wrongly detect large PDA in 13 of the 100 infants. Similarly, if the NT‐proBNP blood test was performed in a group of 100 preterm infants who may have a large problematic PDA, the NT‐proBNP blood test would miss only two of these infants but may wrongly detect large PDA in 11 of the 100 infants.

How reliable are the results of the studies in this review?

We have little confidence in the evidence because the results of the studies were inconsistent and variable.

Who do the results of this review apply to?

Preterm infants who are in the hospital for prematurity and are suspected to have a large PDA.

What are the implications of this review?

The blood tests were accurate enough to consider being used as first‐line tests, even though they were variable. Depending on the results, an echo could then be considered if needed. Such an approach may decrease the need for echo, which can be expensive and time consuming, requiring specialised equipment and trained personnel.

How up‐to‐date is this review?

The review included studies published up to September 2021.","Title: Brain natriuretic peptide and N‐terminal brain natriuretic peptide for the diagnosis of haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus in preterm neonates

Abstract: Background Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a common problem in preterm infants. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N‐terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) for the diagnosis of haemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA) in preterm infants. Methods This prospective study was conducted at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Cairo University Children's Hospital between November 2015 and November 2016. BNP and NT‐proBNP were measured in 40 preterm infants (18 males and 22 females) with gestational age ≤ 35 weeks and birth weight ≤ 2000 g who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for ≥ 48 h. Infants with other congenital anomalies, major cardiac malformations or chromosomal abnormalities were excluded. The infants were classified into two groups according to the results of colour‐flow Doppler echocardiography. Group I included 20 infants with hsPDA and group II included 20 infants with no hsPDA. Results The median BNP levels were 350 pg/mL (range 130–780) in group I and 245 pg/mL (range 145–360) in group II (P = 0.014). The median NT‐proBNP levels were 333 pg/mL (range 145–450) in group I and 225 pg/mL (range 135–325) in group II (P = 0.016). BNP and NT‐proBNP had a sensitivity of 80% and 85%, respectively, for the diagnosis of hsPDA. The area under the curve was 0.84 for BNP and 0.86 for NT‐proBNP. The best cutoff value for BNP was 335 pg/mL with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 75%, and the best cutoff value for NT‐proBNP was 265 pg/mL with a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 75%. Conclusion BNP and NT‐proBNP are sensitive markers for the diagnosis of hsPDA in preterm infants.</s>","# Brain natriuretic peptide and N‐terminal brain natriuretic peptide for the diagnosis of haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus in preterm neonates

Dear Editor,

The patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is one of the most common congenital heart defects in neonates, occurring in 2–3% of all live births.1 Early diagnosis and treatment of PDA are of utmost importance for a favourable outcome.2 A high index of suspicion for PDA is needed in the first 24 hours of life. The most widely used screening tool is the assessment of the clinical signs of respiratory distress. A score of >3 on the modified clinical score (MCS) is considered to be suggestive of a haemodynamically significant PDA.2

In preterm neonates, the use of serum or plasma levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N‐terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) is also used for the diagnosis of PDA. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of serum levels of BNP and NT‐proBNP in predicting a haemodynamically significant PDA in preterm neonates.

The study was conducted in the Department of Pediatrics, Dr. D. Y. Patil Medical College and Research Centre, Pimpri, Pune, India. The study included all neonates with a gestational age <37 weeks and birth weight <2.5 kg, who were admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) for the treatment of a clinically suspected PDA. Neonates with congenital heart disease or other congenital anomalies, those who were intubated or ventilated, those with an open fontanelle, those with clinical signs of infection or septicemia, and those who had received inotropes or inotropes and/or surfactant within the previous 24 hours were excluded from the study.

After obtaining informed consent from the parents, a detailed history was taken and a thorough physical examination was performed. A clinical score (CS) was calculated as per the modified clinical score (MCS).2 Echocardiography was performed to confirm the diagnosis of PDA and to determine its haemodynamic significance. The diagnosis of a PDA was made if the left atrium to aortic root ratio (LA/Ao) was >1.4 or if the left atrium to left ventricular end‐diastolic dimension ratio (LA/LVEDD) was >1.5. A haemodynamically significant PDA was diagnosed if the maximum velocity across the ductus arteriosus (DA) was >2.5 m/s.3

Blood samples were collected at the time of diagnosis of PDA and within 24 hours of the initiation of treatment. Serum levels of BNP and NT‐proBNP were estimated using the Elecsys proBNP II (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and Elecsys proBNP II (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) kits, respectively.

A total of 60 neonates were included in the study. The mean gestational age and birth weight were 29.5 ± 2.8 weeks and 1241 ± 436 g, respectively. The mean clinical score was 6.6 ± 1.6. Echocardiography was performed in all the neonates and the diagnosis of PDA was confirmed in 48 (80%) neonates. The diagnosis of PDA was made on the basis of the left atrium to aortic root ratio (LA/Ao) in 44 (73.3%) neonates and on the basis of the left atrium to left ventricular end‐diastolic dimension ratio (LA/LVEDD) in 4 (6.6%) neonates. A haemodynamically significant PDA was diagnosed in 28 (58.3%) neonates. The mean serum levels of BNP and NT‐proBNP were significantly higher in the neonates with a haemodynamically significant PDA compared with the neonates with a non‐significant PDA (218.7 ± 120.9 vs. 104.5 ± 54.5 pg/mL; P = 0.002 and 427.9 ± 154.9 vs. 214.8 ± 101.3 pg/mL; P = 0.002, respectively).

The serum levels of BNP and NT‐proBNP were significantly higher in the neonates with a haemodynamically significant PDA. The serum levels of BNP and NT‐proBNP can be used to predict a haemodynamically significant PDA in preterm neonates.

CD012843.pub2,Tranexamic acid for the reduction of bleeding during functional endoscopic sinus surgery,2023,February,21,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012843.pub2,ENT,"Ear, nose & throat","Background
Chronic rhinosinusitis, with or without nasal polyps, can have a major impact on a person's quality of life. Treatment is usually conservative and may include nasal saline, intranasal corticosteroids, antibiotics or systemic corticosteroids. If these treatments fail endoscopic sinus surgery can be considered. During surgery, visibility of the surgical field is important for the identification of important anatomic landmarks and structures that contribute to safety. Impaired visualisation can lead to complications during surgery, inability to complete the operation or a longer duration of surgery. Different methods are used to decrease intraoperative bleeding, including induced hypotension, topical or systemic vasoconstrictors or total intravenous anaesthesia. Another option is tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic agent, which can be administered topically or intravenously.

Objectives
To assess the effects of peri‐operative tranexamic acid versus no therapy or placebo on operative parameters in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (with or without nasal polyps) who are undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS).

Search methods
The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 10 February 2022.

Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intravenous, oral or topical tranexamic acid with no therapy or placebo in the treatment of patients (adults and children) with chronic rhinosinusitis, with or without nasal polyps, undergoing FESS.

Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcome measures were surgical field bleeding score (e.g. Wormald or Boezaart grading system), intraoperative blood loss and significant adverse effects (seizures or thromboembolism within 12 weeks of surgery). Secondary outcomes were duration of surgery, incomplete surgery, surgical complications and postoperative bleeding (placing of packing or revision surgery) in the first two weeks after surgery. We performed subgroup analyses for methods of administration, different dosages, different forms of anaesthesia, use of thromboembolic prophylaxis and children versus adults. We evaluated each included study for risk of bias and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main results
We included 14 studies in the review, with a total of 942 participants. Sample sizes in the included studies ranged from 10 to 170. All but two studies included adult patients (≥ 18 years). Two studies included children. Most studies had more male patients (range 46.6% to 80%). All studies were placebo‐controlled and four studies had three treatment arms. Three studies investigated topical tranexamic acid; the other studies reported the use of intravenous tranexamic acid.

For our primary outcome, surgical field bleeding score measured with the Boezaart or Wormald grading score, we pooled data from 13 studies. The pooled result demonstrated that tranexamic acid probably reduces the surgical field bleeding score, with a standardised mean difference (SMD) of ‐0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.23 to ‐0.51; 13 studies, 772 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). A SMD below ‐0.70 represents a large effect (in either direction).

Tranexamic acid may result in a slight reduction in blood loss during surgery compared to placebo with a mean difference (MD) of ‐70.32 mL (95% CI ‐92.28 to ‐48.35 mL; 12 studies, 802 participants; low‐certainty evidence).

Tranexamic acid probably has little to no effect on the development of significant adverse events (seizures or thromboembolism) within 24 hours of surgery, with no events in either group and a risk difference (RD) of 0.00 (95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.02; 8 studies, 664 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, there were no studies reporting significant adverse event data with a longer duration of follow‐up.

Tranexamic acid probably results in little difference in the duration of surgery with a MD of ‐13.04 minutes (95% CI ‐19.27 to ‐6.81; 10 studies, 666 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Tranexamic acid probably results in little to no difference in the incidence of incomplete surgery, with no events in either group and a RD of 0.00 (95% CI ‐0.09 to 0.09; 2 studies, 58 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and likely results in little to no difference in surgical complications, again with no events in either group and a RD of 0.00 (95% CI ‐0.09 to 0.09; 2 studies, 58 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), although these numbers are too small to draw robust conclusions. Tranexamic acid may result in little to no difference in the likelihood of postoperative bleeding (placement of packing or revision surgery within three days of surgery) (RD ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.02; 6 studies, 404 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There were no studies with longer follow‐up.

Authors' conclusions
There is moderate‐certainty evidence to support the beneficial value of topical or intravenous tranexamic acid during endoscopic sinus surgery with respect to surgical field bleeding score. Low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence suggests a slight decrease in total blood loss during surgery and duration of surgery. Whilst there is moderate‐certainty evidence that tranexamic acid does not lead to more immediate significant adverse events compared to placebo, there is no evidence regarding the risk of serious adverse events more than 24 hours after surgery. There is low‐certainty evidence that tranexamic acid may not change postoperative bleeding. There is not enough evidence available to draw robust conclusions about incomplete surgery or surgical complications.","Does tranexamic acid (a medicine used to improve blood clotting) reduce bleeding during endoscopic surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis?
What is chronic rhinosinusitis?

Chronic rhinosinusitis is an inflammation of the sinuses that has lasted for at least 12 weeks. People with chronic rhinosinusitis can experience symptoms such as a blocked or runny nose, a feeling of facial pain or pressure, or a reduction or loss of the sense of smell. Some people may also have polyps in their nose, which can worsen the symptoms.

How is chronic rhinosinusitis treated?

Chronic rhinosinusitis is usually treated with medicines such as saline sprays or rinses, anti‐inflammatory sprays/drops (steroids), antibiotics or anti‐inflammatory steroid tablets. If the symptoms continue despite this treatment, surgery can be performed.

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to see if tranexamic acid, a medicine used to improve blood clotting, could be effective during endoscopic sinus surgery by reducing bleeding, which then potentially reduces the risk of complications. Less bleeding means that surgeons have a better view of the sinuses when they are operating.

What did we do?

We searched for studies that investigated tranexamic acid (either given in the vein or directly applied in the nose by sprays or drops) compared with a placebo (dummy treatment) or no tranexamic acid. We were interested in both children and adults. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.

What did we find?

We found 14 studies, with a total of 942 participants, which compared tranexamic acid to normal saline (placebo ‐ dummy treatment) in patients having endoscopic sinus surgery. In 10 studies the treatment was given in a vein and in three it was applied in the nose. All studies used different amounts of the drug.

We found that tranexamic acid probably greatly improves the view of the surgeon (based on 13 studies), may slightly reduce total blood loss during surgery (12 studies) and likely does not cause any serious side effects within 24 hours of surgery (i.e. blood clot formation in the brain or seizures ‐ there were no such events in either the treatment or placebo groups) (eight studies). Unfortunately, there is no evidence with respect to serious side effects at a longer duration of follow‐up.

The duration of the surgery was investigated in 10 studies. The duration of surgery is probably slightly lower with tranexamic acid.

Only two studies investigated complications related to surgery and difficulty completing the surgery as planned. In these studies no difference was seen between the tranexamic acid and placebo groups. However, because these complications are rare no conclusions can be drawn based on these studies. 
Nosebleeds after surgery that required intervention (placing of nasal tampons or further surgery) were investigated in six studies. Only two studies reported a patient treated with saline solution (placebo) who experienced a nosebleed after surgery. Tranexamic acid may not make a difference to the likelihood of postoperative bleeding.

Based on the evidence in the studies we cannot conclude whether tranexamic acid given either in a vein or applied in the nose is better. We also cannot conclude whether a particular dose of tranexamic acid is better.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

We are moderately confident about the evidence for the improvement of the view of the surgeon during surgery, but further research may have an impact on the estimate of the effect. We have less confidence in the evidence for lower blood loss during surgery, meaning that the true effect could be very different after more research. For the occurrence of serious side effects within 24 hours after surgery (blood clot formation in the brain or seizures) we are confident that more research would probably not change our findings.

How up‐to‐date is the evidence?

The evidence is up‐to‐date to February 2022. ","Title: Tranexamic acid for the reduction of bleeding during functional endoscopic sinus surgery

Abstract: Background: Bleeding is one of the most common complications encountered during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous (IV) tranexamic acid (TXA) in reducing bleeding during FESS. Methods: A total of 84 patients who underwent FESS were randomly divided into two groups: the control group (n = 42) received a placebo (normal saline) and the treatment group (n = 42) received a single dose of IV TXA (1 g) 30 minutes before surgery. The primary outcome was blood loss (g) during surgery. Secondary outcomes included blood loss in suction bottles, hemoglobin (Hb) drop, and total drainage volume (ml). Results: The mean blood loss (g) in the control group was 49.15 ± 19.41 and 28.61 ± 14.62 in the treatment group (P < 0.001). The mean blood loss in suction bottles was 114.61 ± 44.42 in the control group and 65.82 ± 33.93 in the treatment group (P < 0.001). The mean Hb drop was 1.14 ± 0.26 in the control group and 0.72 ± 0.16 in the treatment group (P < 0.001). The mean total drainage volume (ml) was 1003.82 ± 249.66 in the control group and 720.68 ± 240.92 in the treatment group (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The use of a single dose of IV TXA (1 g) 30 minutes before surgery can significantly reduce blood loss during FESS.</s>","# Tranexamic acid for the reduction of bleeding during functional endoscopic sinus surgery

A medication review can be defined as a structured evaluation of a patient's medication conducted by healthcare professionals with the aim of optimising medication use and improving health outcomes. Optimising medication therapy though medication reviews may benefit hospitalised patients.

Objectives
We examined the effects of medication review interventions in hospitalised adult patients compared to standard care or to other types of medication reviews on all‐cause mortality, hospital readmissions, emergency department contacts and health‐related quality of life.

Search methods
In this Cochrane Review update, we searched for new published and unpublished trials using the following electronic databases from 1 January 2014 to 17 January 2022 without language restrictions: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). To identify additional trials, we searched the reference lists of included trials and other publications by lead trial authors, and contacted experts.

Selection criteria
We included randomised trials of medication reviews delivered by healthcare professionals for hospitalised adult patients. We excluded trials including outpatients and paediatric patients.

Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for data clarification and relevant unpublished data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous data (with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)). We used the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to assess the overall certainty of the evidence.

Main results
In this updated review, we included a total of 25 trials (15,076 participants), of which 15 were new trials (11,501 participants). Follow‐up ranged from 1 to 20 months. We found that medication reviews in hospitalised adults may have little to no effect on mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.05; 18 trials, 10,108 participants; low‐certainty evidence); likely reduce hospital readmissions (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98; 17 trials, 9561 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); may reduce emergency department contacts (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.03; 8 trials, 3527 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and have very uncertain effects on health‐related quality of life (SMD 0.10, 95% CI ‐0.10 to 0.30; 4 trials, 392 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions
Medication reviews in hospitalised adult patients likely reduce hospital readmissions and may reduce emergency department contacts. The evidence suggests that mediation reviews may have little to no effect on mortality, while the effect on health‐related quality of life is very uncertain. Almost all trials included elderly polypharmacy patients, which limits the generalisability of the results beyond this population.","What are the benefits and risks of medication reviews for hospitalised adults?
Key messages

Medication reviews in hospitalised adults likely reduce hospital readmissions but may have little to no effect on mortality.

What is a medication review?

A medication review is a structured intervention conducted by healthcare professionals in order to optimise an individual patient’s medication and improve health outcomes.

What did we want to find out?

Whether medication reviews improve the health of hospitalised adult patients.

What did we do?

We searched for trials that examined medication reviews compared with usual care or trials that examined two or more types of medication reviews in hospitalised adults. We compared and summarised the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the evidence.

What did we find?

We found that medication reviews in hospitalised adult patients likely reduce hospital readmissions and may reduce emergency department contacts. However, medication reviews may have little to no effect on mortality, and it is unclear if medication reviews have an effect on health‐related quality of life.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

Almost all trials included elderly patients taking a high number of medications, so we may not be able to generalise the results to other types of patients.

How up to date is this evidence?

We searched electronic databases and other sources for trials that had been published up to January 2022.
","Title: Medication review in hospitalised patients to reduce morbidity and mortality

Abstract: Background Medication review is an integral component of care for patients with multimorbidity. Medication review has been shown to reduce the risk of potentially inappropriate prescribing and to reduce hospital readmissions and mortality. However, medication review has been shown to be cost effective only in the short term. Aim To determine the cost effectiveness of medication review in hospitalised patients with multimorbidity. Method This is a cost effectiveness analysis alongside a cluster randomised controlled trial. Patients with multimorbidity will be recruited from the emergency department and acute medical units at four hospital sites. The intervention will be an intensive medication review by a clinical pharmacist and an experienced general practitioner. The primary outcome will be the cost effectiveness of the intervention. The secondary outcomes will be the impact of the intervention on the risk of hospital readmission and mortality. The trial will run for 12 months and will recruit 1000 patients. Results The results of this study will provide information on the cost effectiveness of an intensive medication review for patients with multimorbidity. Conclusion This study will provide the basis for a decision regarding the implementation of medication review as part of the care of patients with multimorbidity.</s>","# Medication review in hospitalised patients to reduce morbidity and mortality

# Clinical question

Can the use of medication review in hospitalised patients improve clinical outcomes?

# Summary of evidence

In 2011, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) issued a quality standard on the use of medication review in hospitals []. The quality standard recommends that ‘Medication review is undertaken by a suitably qualified health professional and should be undertaken to assess whether a patient’s medication needs are being met and to make recommendations for change’.

This quality standard was updated in 2015 [] and a systematic review of the evidence was commissioned by the NICE evidence review group (ERG) to inform the update. The systematic review identified 15 randomised controlled trials of medication review that included more than 2000 patients [].

The review found that medication review led to significant improvements in several clinical outcomes including: reduction in hospital readmissions; reduced rates of hospital admissions; reduced hospital length of stay; and improved clinical outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and those with polypharmacy. However, there was no evidence of a reduction in all-cause mortality. The review concluded that medication review can improve clinical outcomes in hospitalised patients but further research is needed to determine the impact of medication review on patient and health service outcomes, and to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from medication review.

The systematic review also highlighted that there was a lack of consistent terminology and definitions used in the studies included in the review. The authors recommended that future studies use standardised terminology and definitions, and that future research focus on evaluating the impact of medication review on patient outcomes and health service outcomes.

# Impact of medication review on medication-related problems

# Clinical question

What is the impact of medication review on the prevalence of medication-related problems?

# Summary of evidence

The systematic review identified 20 studies that reported the prevalence of medication-related problems in hospitalised patients []. Most studies were conducted in the United States (US) and used the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) medication-related problems framework to measure the prevalence of medication-related problems. The review identified a range of prevalence rates from 12% to 95% depending on the population studied and the outcome measured.

The review found that the prevalence of medication-related problems is higher in patients with polypharmacy, older age and in patients with complex comorbidities. There was no evidence of a difference in the prevalence of medication-related problems between hospitalised patients who received medication review and those who did not.

The authors of the systematic review recommend that future research focus on identifying the prevalence of medication-related problems in patients who have received medication review, and the impact of medication review on the prevalence of medication-related problems.

# Medication review as a component of transitional care

# Clinical question

Can medication review in the hospital and in the community improve patient outcomes and health service outcomes?

# Summary of evidence

In 2011, NICE issued a quality standard on the use of transitional care []. The quality standard recommends that ‘Transitional care is an ongoing process for supporting patients to manage their health, improve or maintain their health and well-being, and reduce the risk of readmission or death’. The quality standard recommends that ‘Transitional care should be a collaborative process involving the patient and their family or carers, the hospital and community health and social care professionals and services’.

The quality standard also recommends that ‘The quality of transitional care is determined by measuring the health outcomes for patients, and by evaluating the costs to patients, their families and the health service’.

This quality standard was updated in 2015 [] and a systematic review of the evidence was commissioned by the NICE evidence review group (ERG) to inform the update. The systematic review identified 12 randomised controlled trials of transitional care that included more than 32,000 patients [].

The review found that transitional care was associated with reduced hospital readmissions, improved clinical outcomes and improved health service outcomes. However, there was no evidence of a reduction in all-cause mortality. The review concluded that transitional care can improve patient outcomes and health service outcomes but further research is needed to identify the impact of transitional care on patient and health service outcomes, and to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from transitional care.

The systematic review also highlighted that there was a lack of consistent terminology and definitions used in the studies included in the review. The authors recommended that future studies use standardised terminology and definitions, and that future research focus on evaluating the impact of transitional care on patient outcomes and health service outcomes.

# Medication review in the community

# Clinical question

Can medication review in the community reduce hospital readmissions?

# Summary of evidence

In 2011, NICE issued a quality standard on the use of medication review in the community []. The quality standard recommends that ‘Medication review should be undertaken in the community setting to reduce the risk of readmission to hospital’.

The quality standard also recommends that ‘The quality of medication review in the community is determined by measuring the health outcomes for patients, and by evaluating the costs to patients, their families and the health service’.

This quality standard was updated in 2015 [] and a systematic review of the evidence was commissioned by the NICE evidence review group (ERG) to inform the update. The systematic review identified four randomised controlled trials of medication review that included more than 2200 patients [].

The review found that medication review was associated with a reduction in hospital readmissions and a reduction in hospital length of stay, but there was no evidence of a reduction in all-cause mortality. The review concluded that medication review can reduce hospital readmissions in patients with chronic kidney disease, COPD and diabetes but further research is needed to determine the impact of medication review on all-cause mortality, and to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from medication review.

The systematic review also highlighted that there was a lack of consistent terminology and definitions used in the studies included in the review. The authors recommended that future studies use standardised terminology and definitions, and that future research focus on evaluating the impact of medication review on all-cause mortality and on the health outcomes for patients.

# Impact of medication review on medication-related problems

# Clinical question

What is the impact of medication review on the prevalence of medication-related problems?

# Summary of evidence

The systematic review identified four studies that reported the prevalence of medication-related problems in the community and the primary care interface []. The prevalence of medication-related problems ranged from 21% to 67% depending on the population studied and the outcome measured.

The review found that the prevalence of medication-related problems is higher in patients with polypharmacy, older age and in patients with complex comorbidities. There was no evidence of a difference in the prevalence of medication-related problems between patients who received medication review and those who did not.

The authors of the systematic review recommend that future research focus on identifying the prevalence of medication-related problems in patients who have received medication review, and the impact of medication review on the prevalence of medication-related problems.

# Discussion

The aim of this review was to identify the evidence on the impact of medication review in the hospital and in the community on clinical outcomes, health service outcomes, and on the prevalence of medication-related problems.

We identified four systematic reviews of the literature that included randomised controlled trials of medication review. These systematic reviews evaluated the impact of medication review on clinical outcomes, health service outcomes, and on the prevalence of medication-related problems. The systematic reviews were published between 2011 and 2015."

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is characterised by neurovascular degeneration as a result of chronic hyperglycaemia. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is the most serious complication of DR and can lead to total (central and peripheral) visual loss. PDR is characterised by the presence of abnormal new blood vessels, so‐called “new vessels,” at the optic disc (NVD) or elsewhere in the retina (NVE). PDR can progress to high‐risk characteristics (HRC) PDR (HRC‐PDR), which is defined by the presence of NVD more than one‐fourth to one‐third disc area in size plus vitreous haemorrhage or pre‐retinal haemorrhage, or vitreous haemorrhage or pre‐retinal haemorrhage obscuring more than one disc area. In severe cases, fibrovascular membranes grow over the retinal surface and tractional retinal detachment with sight loss can occur, despite treatment. Although most, if not all, individuals with diabetes will develop DR if they live long enough, only some progress to the sight‐threatening PDR stage. 

Objectives
To determine risk factors for the development of PDR and HRC‐PDR in people with diabetes and DR.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2022, Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE, and Ovid Embase. The date of the search was 27 May 2022. Additionally, the search was supplemented by screening reference lists of eligible articles. There were no restrictions to language or year of publication. 

Selection criteria
We included prospective or retrospective cohort studies and case‐control longitudinal studies evaluating prognostic factors for the development and progression of PDR, in people who have not had previous treatment for DR. The target population consisted of adults (≥18 years of age) of any gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geographical location, with non‐proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) or PDR with less than HRC‐PDR, diagnosed as per standard clinical practice. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts, and full‐text articles, to determine eligibility; discrepancies were resolved through discussion. We considered prognostic factors measured at baseline and any other time points during the study and in any clinical setting. Outcomes were evaluated at three and eight years (± two years) or lifelong. 

Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data from included studies using a data extraction form that we developed and piloted prior to the data collection stage. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion. We used the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool to assess risk of bias. We conducted meta‐analyses in clinically relevant groups using a random‐effects approach. We reported hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR), and risk ratios (RR) separately for each available prognostic factor and outcome, stratified by different time points. Where possible, we meta‐analysed adjusted prognostic factors. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence with an adapted version of the GRADE framework.  

Main results
We screened 6391 records. From these, we identified 59 studies (87 articles) as eligible for inclusion. Thirty‐five were prospective cohort studies, 22 were retrospective studies, 18 of which were cohort and six were based on data from electronic registers, and two were retrospective case‐control studies. Twenty‐three studies evaluated participants with type 1 diabetes (T1D), 19 with type 2 diabetes (T2D), and 17 included mixed populations (T1D and T2D). Studies on T1D included between 39 and 3250 participants at baseline, followed up for one to 45 years. Studies on T2D included between 100 and 71,817 participants at baseline, followed up for one to 20 years. The studies on mixed populations of T1D and T2D ranged from 76 to 32,553 participants at baseline, followed up for four to 25 years. 

We found evidence indicating that higher glycated haemoglobin (haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)) levels (adjusted OR ranged from 1.11 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.32) to 2.10 (95% CI 1.64 to 2.69) and more advanced stages of retinopathy (adjusted OR ranged from 1.38 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.48) to 12.40 (95% CI 5.31 to 28.98) are independent risk factors for the development of PDR in people with T1D and T2D. We rated the evidence for these factors as of moderate certainty because of moderate to high risk of bias in the studies. 

There was also some evidence suggesting several markers for renal disease (for example, nephropathy (adjusted OR ranged from 1.58 (95% CI not reported) to 2.68 (2.09 to 3.42), and creatinine (adjusted meta‐analysis HR 1.61 (95% CI 0.77 to 3.36)), and, in people with T1D, age at diagnosis of diabetes (< 12 years of age) (standardised regression estimate 1.62, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.48), increased triglyceride levels (adjusted RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.95), and larger retinal venular diameters (RR 4.28, 95% CI 1.50 to 12.19) may increase the risk of progression to PDR. The certainty of evidence for these factors, however, was low to very low, due to risk of bias in the included studies, inconsistency (lack of studies preventing the grading of consistency or variable outcomes), and imprecision (wide CIs). There was no substantial and consistent evidence to support duration of diabetes, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, low‐ (LDL) and high‐ (HDL) density lipoproteins, gender, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), socioeconomic status, or tobacco and alcohol consumption as being associated with incidence of PDR. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate prognostic factors associated with progression of PDR to HRC‐PDR. 

Authors' conclusions
Increased HbA1c is likely to be associated with progression to PDR; therefore, maintaining adequate glucose control throughout life, irrespective of stage of DR severity, may help to prevent progression to PDR and risk of its sight‐threatening complications. Renal impairment in people with T1D or T2D, as well as younger age at diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM), increased triglyceride levels, and increased retinal venular diameters in people with T1D may also be associated with increased risk of progression to PDR. Given that more advanced DR severity is associated with higher risk of progression to PDR, the earlier the disease is identified, and the above systemic risk factors are controlled, the greater the chance of reducing the risk of PDR and saving sight.","Risk factors for the development and progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (a diabetes complication affecting eyes)
Review question

We wanted to find out which factors may increase or reduce the chance that people with diabetes develop proliferative diabetic retinopathy and high‐risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy, both sight‐threatening complications of diabetes.

Background

In diabetes, over time, raised blood sugar levels damage fine blood vessels in the retina, the layer at the back of the eye that gives people sight. This is called ‘diabetic retinopathy’. In some people with diabetes and diabetic retinopathy, abnormal and fragile blood vessels grow in the retina: so‐called 'new vessels'. When new vessels are present, we say there is 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', also called 'PDR'. These new vessels are weak and can bleed inside the eye, causing what is known as a 'vitreous haemorrhage'. The blood inside the eye takes away the vision, although, if it clears on its own (which sometimes happens) or with surgery, vision most often recovers. Scar tissue can also grow over the new vessels. Scarring can pull on the retina and cause what is known as a tractional retinal detachment, the most severe sight‐threatening complication of diabetic retinopathy. Tractional retinal detachment can cause total blindness if not treated with surgery promptly.

While most people with diabetes develop diabetic retinopathy, only a few progress to these severe complications. It is unclear why this is the case. Sight loss is usually preventable if treatment is done early. Therefore, it is essential to know who is at risk of progressing to PDR, so that these people can be followed closely and treated in a timely way. We did this review to find out the risk factors which may determine why some people develop PDR. 

Study characteristics

We included studies in which people with diabetes, who had never been treated for diabetic retinopathy, were followed up over time to determine who developed PDR and who progressed to severe stages of PDR (called 'high‐risk characteristics PDR' (HRC‐PDR)). To be included in our review, these studies had to investigate risk factors for PDR and HRC‐PDR: for example, blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol, and kidney disease, amongst others. We included studies looking at adults (18 years of age and older) of any gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and nation, written in any language, in this review.

Key results

Of the 6391 articles we found, 59 studies (87 articles) were eligible, and we included them in our review. We found that higher blood sugar (which means poorer diabetes control) and more advanced diabetic retinopathy (more changes from diabetes in the retina) put people at higher risk of having PDR. People with kidney disease seemed also to be at higher risk of progressing to PDR. It is also possible that people with type 1 diabetes who were diagnosed at a young age, and those with higher triglyceride levels (triglycerides are a type of fat in the blood, like cholesterol) or who have retinal veins with larger diameters, are more at risk of developing PDR. Other risk factors studied ‐ for example, duration of diabetes, blood pressure, and cholesterol ‐ did not seem to be risk factors for PDR. There was not enough information from the included studies for us to analyse risk factors for HRC‐PDR. 

Authors' conclusions

People living with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who have poor blood sugar control are likely to be at increased risk of developing PDR. Evidence suggests that better blood sugar control, even in people who already have the earlier stages of diabetic retinopathy, may help to prevent it from progressing to PDR. Those with kidney disease may also be at increased risk of progressing to PDR. Additionally, people with type 1 diabetes, who were diagnosed at a younger age, or who have higher triglyceride levels or larger retinal veins, may be more susceptible to developing PDR.

Abstract: Purpose 
 
To evaluate prognostic factors for the development and progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in people with diabetic retinopathy. 
 
 
 
Methods 
 
Retrospective cohort study. 
 
 
 
Patients 
 
A total of 431 people with diabetic retinopathy were followed for a mean of 3.4 years. 
 
 
 
Methods 
 
Multivariable regression analysis was performed to determine the association of prognostic factors with the development of PDR and its progression to high-risk PDR. 
 
 
 
Results 
 
The incidence of PDR was 11.4% and the incidence of high-risk PDR was 5.4%. The development of PDR was associated with older age (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04–1.10), higher glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.07–1.62), and higher serum creatinine (HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00–1.02). The development of high-risk PDR was associated with older age (HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01–1.09), higher HbA1c (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.09–1.69), and higher serum creatinine (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00–1.03). The progression of PDR to high-risk PDR was associated with higher HbA1c (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.02–1.54). 
 
 
 
Conclusions 
 
Higher HbA1c and older age were associated with the development of PDR and its progression to high-risk PDR. Higher HbA1c was also associated with the progression of PDR to high-risk PDR.</s>","# Prognostic factors for the development and progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetic retinopathy

The results of the multivariate analysis of prognostic factors for the development and progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetic retinopathy are presented in Table 3. The variables that were statistically significant in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis. A history of proliferative diabetic retinopathy was a significant risk factor for the development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.46–3.94, p = 0.001). In contrast, a history of diabetic macular edema was a significant protective factor for the development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (adjusted HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.26–0.83, p = 0.009). Age (≥60 years) (adjusted HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.07–2.78, p = 0.026), HbA1c (≥7.5%) (adjusted HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12–2.75, p = 0.014), and the presence of diabetic macular edema (adjusted HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29–0.85, p = 0.011) were significant prognostic factors for the progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy.Table 3: Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors for the development and progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetic retinopathy

# Discussion

In this study, we evaluated the natural course of proliferative diabetic retinopathy and identified prognostic factors for the development and progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetic retinopathy. The main findings of this study are as follows: (1) the incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy was 3.12%; (2) the cumulative incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy was 11.1% after 5 years, 20.8% after 10 years, and 30.4% after 15 years; (3) a history of proliferative diabetic retinopathy was a significant risk factor for the development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, while a history of diabetic macular edema was a significant protective factor for the development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy; and (4) age (≥60 years), HbA1c (≥7.5%), and the presence of diabetic macular edema were significant prognostic factors for the progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

The incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy was 3.12% in this study. In a retrospective study of patients with diabetes who were treated at a hospital in Japan, the incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy was 12.5% at 1 year and 20.3% at 2 years after the initial examination [[START_REF] Incidence of diabetic retinopathy in a hospital-based diabetic retinopathy screening program, Shiga[END_REF]]. In another retrospective study of patients with diabetes who were treated at a hospital in Korea, the incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy was 2.6% at 1 year and 7.9% at 2 years after the initial examination [[START_REF] Incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy in Korean patients with type 2 diabetes, Lee[END_REF]]. These results suggest that the incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in Japan is lower than that in Korea and that the incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy increases over time.

In this study, the cumulative incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy was 11.1% after 5 years, 20.8% after 10 years, and 30.4% after 15 years. These results suggest that the incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy increases over time. In a retrospective study of patients with diabetes who were treated at a hospital in Japan, the cumulative incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy was 24.4% after 10 years [[START_REF] Incidence of diabetic retinopathy in a hospital-based diabetic retinopathy screening program, Shiga[END_REF]]. In another retrospective study of patients with diabetes who were treated at a hospital in Korea, the cumulative incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy was 31.7% after 10 years [[START_REF] Incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy in Korean patients with type 2 diabetes, Lee[END_REF]]. These results suggest that the cumulative incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in Japan is lower than that in Korea and that the cumulative incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy increases over time.

In this study, the most common type of proliferative diabetic retinopathy was vitreous hemorrhage. In a retrospective study of patients with diabetes who were treated at a hospital in Japan, the most common type of proliferative diabetic retinopathy was vitreous hemorrhage [[START_REF] Incidence of diabetic retinopathy in a hospital-based diabetic retinopathy screening program, Shiga[END_REF]]. In another retrospective study of patients with diabetes who were treated at a hospital in Korea, the most common type of proliferative diabetic retinopathy was vitreous hemorrhage [[START_REF] Incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy in Korean patients with type 2 diabetes, Lee[END_REF]]. These results suggest that the type of proliferative diabetic retinopathy is not different between Japan and Korea.

In this study, the cumulative incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy was 24.4% after 10 years in people with proliferative diabetic retinopathy at the initial examination [[START_REF] Incidence of diabetic retinopathy in a hospital-based diabetic retinopathy screening program, Shiga[END_REF]]. In another retrospective study of patients with diabetes who were treated at a hospital in Korea, the cumulative incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy was 31.7% after 10 years in people with proliferative diabetic retinopathy at the initial examination [[START_REF] Incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy in Korean patients with type 2 diabetes, Lee[END_REF]]. These results suggest that the cumulative incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in Japan is lower than that in Korea.

These results suggest that the cumulative incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in Japan is lower than that in Korea.

The results of this study showed that the presence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy at the initial examination was a significant risk factor for the development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. In a retrospective study of patients with diabetes who were treated at a hospital in Japan, the presence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy at the initial examination was a significant risk factor for the development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy [[START_REF] Incidence of diabetic retinopathy in a hospital-based diabetic retinopathy screening program, Shiga[END_REF]].

These results suggest that the presence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy at the initial examination is a significant risk factor for the development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

In this study, the presence of diabetic macular edema at the initial examination was a significant protective factor for the development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. In a retrospective study of patients with diabetes who were treated at a hospital in Japan, the presence of diabetic macular edema at the initial examination was a significant protective factor for the development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy [[START_REF] Incidence of diabetic retinopathy in a hospital-based diabetic retinopathy screening program, Shiga[END_REF]].

These results suggest that the presence of diabetic macular edema at the initial examination is a significant protective factor for the development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

In this study, age (≥60 years) was a significant prognostic factor for the progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. In a retrospective study of patients with diabetes who were treated at a hospital in Japan, age (≥60 years) was a significant prognostic factor for the progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy [[START_REF] Incidence of diabetic retinopathy in a hospital-based diabetic retinopathy screening program, Shiga[END_REF]].

CD012849.pub2,Probiotics for management of functional abdominal pain disorders in children,2023,February,17,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012849.pub2,Gut,Gastroenterology & hepatology,"Background
Functional abdominal pain is pain occurring in the abdomen that cannot be fully explained by another medical condition and is common in children. It has been hypothesised that the use of micro‐organisms, such as probiotics and synbiotics (a mixture of probiotics and prebiotics), might change the composition of bacterial colonies in the bowel and reduce inflammation, as well as promote normal gut physiology and reduce functional symptoms.

Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics in the treatment of functional abdominal pain disorders in children.

Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and two clinical trials registers from inception to October 2021.

Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compare probiotic preparations (including synbiotics) to placebo, no treatment or any other interventional preparation in patients aged between 4 and 18 years of age with a diagnosis of functional abdominal pain disorder according to the Rome II, Rome III or Rome IV criteria.

Data collection and analysis
The primary outcomes were treatment success as defined by the primary studies, complete resolution of pain, improvement in the severity of pain and improvement in the frequency of pain. Secondary outcomes included serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, adverse events, school performance or change in school performance or attendance, social and psychological functioning or change in social and psychological functioning, and quality of life or change in quality life measured using any validated scoring tool. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) and corresponding 95% CI.

Main results
We included 18 RCTs assessing the effectiveness of probiotics and synbiotics in reducing the severity and frequency of pain, involving a total of 1309 patients.

Probiotics may achieve more treatment success when compared with placebo at the end of the treatment, with 50% success in the probiotic group versus 33% success in the placebo group (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.36; 554 participants; 6 studies; I2 = 70%; low‐certainty evidence). 

It is not clear whether probiotics are more effective than placebo for complete resolution of pain, with 42% success in the probiotic group versus 27% success in the placebo group (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.56; 460 participants; 6 studies; I2 = 70%; very low‐certainty evidence). We judged the evidence to be of very low certainty due to high inconsistency and risk of bias.

We were unable to draw meaningful conclusions from our meta‐analyses of the pain severity and pain frequency outcomes due to very high unexplained heterogeneity leading to very low‐certainty evidence.

None of the included studies reported serious adverse events. Meta‐analysis showed no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events between probiotics (1/275) and placebo (1/269) (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.12). The results were identical for the total patients with any reported adverse event outcome. However, these results are of very low certainty due to imprecision from the very low numbers of events and risk of bias.

Synbiotics may result in more treatment success at study end when compared with placebo, with 47% success in the probiotic group versus 35% success in the placebo group (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.74; 310 participants; 4 studies; I2 = 0%; low certainty). One study used Bifidobacterium coagulans/fructo‐oligosaccharide, one used Bifidobacterium lactis/inulin, one used Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG/inulin and in one study this was not stated). 

Synbiotics may result in little difference in complete resolution of pain at study end when compared with placebo, with 52% success in the probiotic group versus 32% success in the placebo group (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.81; 131 participants; 2 studies; I2 = 18%; low‐certainty evidence).

We were unable to draw meaningful conclusions from our meta‐analyses of pain severity or frequency of pain due to very high unexplained heterogeneity leading to very low‐certainty evidence. 

None of the included studies reported serious adverse events. Meta‐analysis showed little to no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events between synbiotics (8/155) and placebo (1/147) (RR 4.58, 95% CI 0.80 to 26.19), or in any reported adverse events (3/96 versus 1/93, RR 2.88, 95% CI 0.32 to 25.92). These results are of very low certainty due to imprecision from the very low numbers of events and risk of bias.

There were insufficient data to analyse by subgroups of specific functional abdominal pain syndrome (irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, abdominal migraine, functional abdominal pain ‐ not otherwise specified) or by specific strain of probiotic.

There was insufficient evidence on school performance or change in school performance/attendance, social and psychological functioning, or quality of life to draw conclusions about the effects of probiotics or synbiotics on these outcomes.

Authors' conclusions
The results from this review demonstrate that probiotics and synbiotics may be more efficacious than placebo in achieving treatment success, but the evidence is of low certainty. The evidence demonstrates little to no difference between probiotics or synbiotics and placebo in complete resolution of pain. We were unable to draw meaningful conclusions about the impact of probiotics or synbiotics on the frequency and severity of pain as the evidence was all of very low certainty due to significant unexplained heterogeneity or imprecision.

There were no reported cases of serious adverse events when using probiotics or synbiotics amongst the included studies, although a review of RCTs may not be the best context to assess long‐term safety. The available evidence on adverse effects was of very low certainty and no conclusions could be made in this review. Safety will always be a priority in paediatric populations when considering any treatment. Reporting of all adverse events, adverse events needing withdrawal, serious adverse events and, particularly, long‐term safety outcomes are vital to meaningfully move forward the evidence base in this field.

Further targeted and appropriately designed RCTs are needed to address the gaps in the evidence base. In particular, appropriate powering of studies to confirm the safety of specific strains not yet investigated and studies to investigate long‐term follow‐up of patients are both warranted.","Probiotics for the management of functional abdominal pain disorders in children
Probiotics for stomach pain in children

Key messages

Probiotics may be better than placebo (dummy treatment) at improving stomach pain for children with functional abdominal pain.

Synbiotics may be better than placebo (dummy treatment) at improving stomach pain for children with functional abdominal pain.

What is functional abdominal pain?

Functional abdominal pain is a common problem in children. The term functional abdominal pain is used when no cause can be found for the symptoms. These symptoms include frequent stomach pain that has lasted for at least six months, which causes problems in daily life.

What are probiotics?

Probiotics are live bacteria and yeasts, promoted as having various health benefits. They are often referred to as 'good bacteria'. It is thought that these probiotics may help the natural balance of bacteria in the gut and may improve symptoms in certain illnesses. They can also be added to agents called prebiotics (foods that support the growth of these bacteria and yeasts) and when these are put together in a single preparation, this is a called a synbiotic.

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to find out if probiotics and synbiotics can be used for the treatment of functional abdominal pain in children and whether they are safe to use.

What did we do?

We searched for studies that looked at probiotics or synbiotics compared with placebo, no treatment or another intervention in children aged between 4 and 18 years with a diagnosis of functional abdominal pain disorder. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.

What did we find?

We found 18 studies with a total of 1309 children, which compared probiotics or synbiotics with placebo.

We found that probiotics may provide better pain relief and relief from other stomach problems than placebo for children with functional abdominal pain. In particular, in children taking probiotics, treatment was judged a success more often than in those taking a placebo. Synbiotics also showed a difference from placebo but this was based on a smaller number of studies. There was not enough information to consider changes in the frequency of pain when comparing synbiotics to placebo.

We cannot reach any conclusions about safety as the evidence we found on any unwanted or harmful effects was of very low certainty.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

The evidence for synbiotics in this review is limited by the fact that the results are from fewer studies. In terms of safety, there were not enough cases of unwanted or harmful effects to give a clear picture about the safety of probiotics and synbiotics.

How up to date is this evidence?

This evidence is up to date to October 2021.","Title: Probiotics for management of functional abdominal pain disorders in children

Abstract: Introduction Functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPD) are chronic pain disorders of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) that have no organic causes and no structural abnormalities in the abdomen on imaging. These disorders are very common in children and affect up to 20% of school children. It can be a chronic and debilitating condition and can affect children's growth and development. The symptoms of FAPD can be chronic or episodic and can include cramping, nausea, vomiting, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and pain. It is associated with poor quality of life, emotional and social problems. The etiology is multifactorial, but the underlying cause of the pain is still unclear. There is no consensus on the management of FAPD in children. The mainstay of management is education, behavioral therapy, and medications. In this review, we discuss the role of probiotics in the management of FAPD in children. Materials and methods We searched PubMed for articles published in English, using the terms ‘probiotics’, ‘functional abdominal pain’, and ‘children’. We reviewed the relevant literature and included all the studies that evaluated the role of probiotics in the management of FAPD in children. Results Probiotics can reduce the frequency of abdominal pain episodes in children with FAPD. Probiotics can also improve the quality of life in children with FAPD. However, larger studies are required to confirm these findings. Conclusion Probiotics may be considered as an adjunctive treatment in the management of FAPD in children.</s>","# Probiotics for management of functional abdominal pain disorders in children

# Introduction

Functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPDs) in children are defined as recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) without organic cause, in the absence of systemic symptoms. RAP can be episodic or chronic. Chronic abdominal pain is defined as abdominal pain lasting for more than 6 months [[START_REF] Chronic recurrent abdominal pain: a practical approach to diagnosis and management., Carroccio[END_REF]]. FAPDs are the most common reason for referrals to pediatric gastroenterologists, accounting for approximately 20% of all consultations. The lifetime prevalence of FAPDs in children is 20–25%, with the highest rates occurring in the 12-year-old age group [[START_REF] Chronic abdominal pain and irritable bowel syndrome in children, Hyman[END_REF], [START_REF] Epidemiology of childhood functional gastrointestinal disorders: a systematic review, Van Kerkhoven[END_REF]]. The prevalence of FAPDs in the community ranges from 2 to 3%, with an annual incidence of 1–2% [[START_REF] Chronic recurrent abdominal pain: a practical approach to diagnosis and management., Carroccio[END_REF], [START_REF] Childhood functional gastrointestinal disorders: child/adolescent., Rasquin[END_REF]].

RAP in children is usually associated with emotional, behavioral, and/or somatic comorbidities [[START_REF] The association between emotional and behavioral problems and functional abdominal pain in children, Van Tilburg[END_REF]]. Children with FAPDs often have high rates of school absence and are less likely to be in regular physical activity [[START_REF] The prevalence of recurrent abdominal pain in a school-aged population, Jones[END_REF]]. The quality of life is reduced in children with FAPDs [[START_REF] Quality of life in children with functional abdominal pain disorders, Van Tilburg[END_REF]]. The overall economic burden is high, and the annual direct costs per patient are estimated at $20,000–30,000 [[START_REF] Economic burden of pediatric functional abdominal pain disorders, Van Tilburg[END_REF]]. The cost of care for children with FAPDs has been shown to be greater than that for children with other chronic illnesses [[START_REF] Cost of illness of irritable bowel syndrome in children and adolescents, Levy[END_REF]].

The pathophysiology of FAPDs is not well understood. FAPDs have been linked to alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiota [[START_REF] The gut microbiome in pediatric functional gastrointestinal disorders: a systematic review, Ringel-Kulka[END_REF]]. Probiotics are live microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host []. The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) defines probiotics as “live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host” [[START_REF] Expert consensus document. The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics consensus statement on the scope and appropriate use of the term probiotic, Hill[END_REF]]. Probiotics have been shown to be effective in the treatment of FAPDs in adults [[START_REF] Meta-analysis: probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome, Nishida[END_REF]]. However, there is limited evidence regarding the use of probiotics in children with FAPDs. This review will discuss the use of probiotics in children with FAPDs.

# Search strategy

A literature search was performed in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases. The following search terms were used: functional abdominal pain disorders, recurrent abdominal pain, functional abdominal pain, functional abdominal pain syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, probiotics, prebiotics, pediatric, children, and randomized controlled trials.

# Probiotics for management of functional abdominal pain disorders in children

# Probiotics for management of functional abdominal pain disorders in children: efficacy

Table 1 summarizes the results of randomized controlled trials of probiotics in children with FAPDs. A systematic review of the use of probiotics in children with FAPDs was performed by Gøtzsche et al. in 2013 [[START_REF] Systematic review: probiotics in the management of lower gastrointestinal symptoms in clinical practice—an evidence-based international guide, Hungin[END_REF]]. The authors concluded that probiotics have no benefit in the management of FAPDs in children. However, the search strategy of this review included studies with a mean follow-up of 3 months, which may not have been sufficient to detect any long-term benefits of probiotics. In a Cochrane review of probiotics in children with FAPDs, there were no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period of more than 12 weeks []. Therefore, the long-term efficacy of probiotics in the management of FAPDs in children is unclear.Table 1: Summary of randomized controlled trials of probiotics in children with FAPDs

In a meta-analysis of RCTs, there was no significant effect of probiotics on the primary outcome of abdominal pain intensity or secondary outcomes of abdominal pain frequency, abdominal pain duration, quality of life, and global improvement in children with FAPDs [[START_REF] Probiotics for the treatment of functional abdominal pain in children: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, Van den Berg[END_REF]]. In a subsequent meta-analysis of RCTs, probiotics were associated with a significant reduction in abdominal pain intensity and abdominal pain frequency [[START_REF] Meta-analysis of probiotics for the treatment of functional abdominal pain in children, Szajewska[END_REF]]. However, there was significant heterogeneity in the primary outcome of abdominal pain intensity, and there was significant publication bias in the meta-analysis of RCTs. Therefore, the overall efficacy of probiotics in the management of FAPDs in children remains unclear.

# Probiotics for management of functional abdominal pain disorders in children: safety

A review of the use of probiotics in children with FAPDs concluded that probiotics are safe and well tolerated in children with FAPDs [[START_REF] Systematic review: probiotics in the management of lower gastrointestinal symptoms in clinical practice—an evidence-based international guide, Hungin[END_REF]]. In a meta-analysis of RCTs, there was no significant difference in adverse events between the probiotic and placebo groups [[START_REF] Probiotics for the treatment of functional abdominal pain in children: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, Van den Berg[END_REF]]. In a meta-analysis of RCTs, there was no significant difference in the number of participants who withdrew from the study because of adverse events [[START_REF] Meta-analysis of probiotics for the treatment of functional abdominal pain in children, Szajewska[END_REF]].

# Probiotics for management of functional abdominal pain disorders in children: clinical guidelines

The use of probiotics in children with FAPDs is not recommended by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) [[START_REF] AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal use of probiotics, Preidis[END_REF]]. The European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) guidelines on irritable bowel syndrome in children state that there is insufficient evidence to recommend probiotics for the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in children [[START_REF] European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition/European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases evidence-based guidelines for the management of irritable bowel syndrome in children in Europe, Levy-Lahad[END_REF]]. The use of probiotics in children with FAPDs is not recommended by the Canadian Society of Gastroenterology [[START_REF] Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for irritable bowel syndrome, Fukudo[END_REF]]. The AGA recommends probiotics in children with FAPDs only if the use of a probiotic with proven efficacy is not feasible [[START_REF] AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal use of probiotics, Preidis[END_REF]].

# Probiotics for management of functional abdominal pain disorders in children: mechanism of action

The mechanism of action of probiotics in the management of FAPDs is not well understood. Probiotics have been shown to reduce visceral hypersensitivity and anxiety-like behaviors in rats with IBS [[START_REF] The beneficial effect of Bifidobacterium longum NCC3001 on murine visceral hypersensitivity is mediated by the central nervous system, Chang[END_REF], [START_REF] Effects of the probiotic Bifidobacterium infantis in the maternal separation model of depression, Desbonnet[END_REF]]. Probiotics may modulate the immune system by stimulating the secretion of immunoglobulin A and decreasing the secretion of interleukin-12 [[START_REF] Probiotics and immune response, Blum[END_REF]]. Probiotics have been shown to improve the intestinal barrier by increasing the expression of zonula occludens-1 and decreasing the expression of claudin-2 [[START_REF] Probiotics restore bowel flora and improve liver enzymes in human alcohol-induced liver injury: a pilot study., Kirpich[END_REF]].

# Probiotics for management of functional abdominal pain disorders in children: future directions

The use of probiotics in the management of FAPDs in children is not recommended by clinical guidelines. There is a paucity of high-quality RCTs with long-term follow-up to guide clinical practice. There is a need for high-quality RCTs to assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics in the management of FAPDs in children.

People with cystic fibrosis (CF) experience chronic airway infections as a result of mucus buildup within the lungs. Repeated infections often cause lung damage and disease. Airway clearance therapies aim to improve mucus clearance, increase sputum production, and improve airway function. The active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) is an airway clearance method that uses a cycle of techniques to loosen airway secretions including breathing control, thoracic expansion exercises, and the forced expiration technique. This is an update of a previously published review.

Objectives
To compare the clinical effectiveness of ACBT with other airway clearance therapies in CF.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched clinical trials registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews.

Date of last search: 29 March 2021.

Selection criteria
We included randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled clinical studies, including cross‐over studies, comparing ACBT with other airway clearance therapies in CF.

Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened each article, abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias of each study. We used GRADE to assess our confidence in the evidence assessing quality of life, participant preference, adverse events, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) % predicted, forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted, sputum weight, and number of pulmonary exacerbations.

Main results
Our search identified 99 studies, of which 22 (559 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Eight randomised controlled studies (259 participants) were included in the analysis; five were of cross‐over design. The 14 remaining studies were cross‐over studies with inadequate reports for complete assessment. The study size ranged from seven to 65 participants. The age of the participants ranged from six to 63 years (mean age 18.7 years). In 13 studies follow up lasted a single day. However, there were two long‐term randomised controlled studies with follow up of one to three years. Most of the studies did not report on key quality items, and therefore, have an unclear risk of bias in terms of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and outcome assessor blinding. Due to the nature of the intervention, none of the studies blinded participants or the personnel applying the interventions. However, most of the studies reported on all planned outcomes, had adequate follow up, assessed compliance, and used an intention‐to‐treat analysis.

Included studies compared ACBT with autogenic drainage, airway oscillating devices (AOD), high‐frequency chest compression devices, conventional chest physiotherapy (CCPT), positive expiratory pressure (PEP), and exercise. We found no difference in quality of life between ACBT and PEP mask therapy, AOD, other breathing techniques, or exercise (very low‐certainty evidence). There was no difference in individual preference between ACBT and other breathing techniques (very low‐certainty evidence). One study comparing ACBT with ACBT plus postural exercise reported no deaths and no adverse events (very low‐certainty evidence). We found no differences in lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) % predicted and forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted), oxygen saturation or expectorated sputum between ACBT and any other technique (very low‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in the number of pulmonary exacerbations between people using ACBT and people using CCPT (low‐certainty evidence) or ACBT with exercise (very low‐certainty evidence), the only comparisons to report this outcome.

Authors' conclusions
There is little evidence to support or reject the use of the ACBT over any other airway clearance therapy and ACBT is comparable with other therapies in outcomes such as participant preference, quality of life, exercise tolerance, lung function, sputum weight, oxygen saturation, and number of pulmonary exacerbations. Longer‐term studies are needed to more adequately assess the effects of ACBT on outcomes important for people with cystic fibrosis such as quality of life and preference.","A comparison of active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) with other methods of airway clearance therapies in people with cystic fibrosis
Review question

What are the effects of active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) compared with other methods of airway clearance in people with cystic fibrosis?

Background

Chronic infections are common in cystic fibrosis, and repeated infections can cause lung damage and disease. People with cystic fibrosis use airway clearance therapies to clear mucus and improve lung function. The ACBT uses a combination of three breathing methods to loosen and clear mucus. This is an update of a previously published review.

Search date

The evidence is current to: 29 March 2021.

Study characteristics

While we included 22 studies comparing ACBT with other airway clearance therapies in the review, only eight studies (259 participants) reported data that we could include in the analysis. Each of the eight studies compared different techniques: ACBT was compared with autogenic drainage, airway oscillating devices, high‐frequency chest compression devices, positive expiratory pressure, conventional chest physiotherapy, and ACBT together with exercise. Most studies lasted a single day, but there were two studies that lasted between one and three years. Participants ranged in age from six to 63 years and most (59%) were male.

Key results

We found that ACBT was comparable with other treatments in outcomes such as quality of life, personal preference, exercise tolerance, lung function, sputum weight, oxygen saturation, and the number of pulmonary exacerbations. We were not able to show that any single technique was better than another. Longer studies are needed to better assess the effects of ACBT on outcomes important for people with cystic fibrosis such as quality of life and personal preference.

Certainty of the evidence

We have little or no confidence in the evidence and think that further research is very likely to affect our conclusions of this review for any of the interventions analysed.

Many of the studies did not provide enough details of their methods to determine if there were any biases that might have affected the results. Many studies did not report how they decided who would get which treatment and how they made sure that the people who were putting people into the different treatment groups and those who were assessing the results did not know which group each individual was in. Most of the included studies had a cross‐over design (where people have one treatment and then switch to the second), and many of these did not report the length of time in between different treatments. As it is possible that the first treatment might affect the results of the next treatment, we only included results from the first treatment period. Many of the studies did not report separate results for just the first treatment period, so we did not include their results in our review.

All participants knew which treatment group they were in (it is not possible to disguise different physiotherapy techniques). This could have affected the results for some of the self‐reported outcomes, such as quality of life, personal preference, or exercise tolerance, but is unlikely to have affected the more objective outcomes, such as lung function.

Most of the studies followed those taking part for less than one month and did this for most of the participants for the entire study period. In two out of the three longer studies more than 10% of the people taking part dropped out. The study results could be affected if the people who dropped out of the studies were not evenly spread across the different treatment groups.

Over half of the studies checked that participants were using the airway clearance therapy they were supposed to. Most of the studies reported on all their planned outcomes.

The findings of the review were limited as not many studies made the same comparisons; also, there were not many long‐term studies and the studies we included did not report enough data.","Title: Active cycle of breathing technique for cystic fibrosis

Abstract: Abstract Objective To assess the effectiveness of active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) in the treatment of chronic respiratory disease. Methods A prospective randomised controlled trial of 30 children with cystic fibrosis. Children were randomly allocated to ACBT or control groups. Both groups received conventional treatment. The ACBT group also received 30 min of ACBT. Outcome measures were changes in spirometry and exercise capacity. Results After 12 weeks, both groups showed a significant improvement in spirometry, and the ACBT group showed a significant improvement in exercise capacity. There were no significant differences between the two groups. Conclusion ACBT was not more effective than conventional treatment in improving pulmonary function and exercise capacity in children with cystic fibrosis.</s>","# Active cycle of breathing technique for cystic fibrosis

The active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) is a simple method for the reduction of airway secretions. It was first described by J.E. McCool in 1966 [[START_REF] The active cycle of breathing technique, McCool[END_REF]].

The ACBT is performed by deep inspiration, exhalation, and a pause. The patient is taught to breath deeply in, exhale as fast as possible and pause for 15 seconds. Then, inhale again to total lung capacity and exhale. The patient is taught to repeat this breathing pattern for 10–15 minutes.

There is no specific treatment for the underlying cause of the disease.

The ACBT has been shown to reduce airway secretions in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. A Cochrane review [[START_REF] Active cycle of breathing technique for cystic fibrosis, Abbot[END_REF]] concluded that ACBT is likely to be more effective than other techniques for reducing the amount of airway secretions in CF patients.

# Non-pharmacological treatment of asthma

# Non-pharmacological treatment of asthma

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, which is characterised by recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing.

Non-pharmacological treatment is recommended in patients with asthma who are not using inhaled medication, or are not using inhaled medication for more than three months. Non-pharmacological treatment may be used as a complementary therapy, or as an alternative to medication.

The guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in adults [] recommend non-pharmacological treatment for asthma in adults who are not using inhaled medication, or are not using inhaled medication for more than three months. Non-pharmacological treatment may be used as a complementary therapy, or as an alternative to medication. Non-pharmacological treatment should be used in conjunction with pharmacological treatment.

The following non-pharmacological interventions are recommended:

* Pulmonary rehabilitation
* Airway clearance
* Airway suctioning
* Breathing exercises
* Relaxation techniques
* Yoga
* Exercise
* Sleep hygiene

# Pulmonary rehabilitation

Pulmonary rehabilitation is defined as a comprehensive, long-term, multidisciplinary intervention that includes exercise training, patient education, and behaviour modification.

It is recommended that pulmonary rehabilitation is offered to all patients with asthma who have been diagnosed with asthma for more than one year.

The guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in adults [] recommends that pulmonary rehabilitation should be offered to patients with asthma who are not using inhaled medication, or are not using inhaled medication for more than three months. Pulmonary rehabilitation may be offered as an alternative to pharmacological treatment.

Pulmonary rehabilitation has been shown to be beneficial in patients with asthma. A systematic review [[START_REF] Pulmonary rehabilitation for adults with asthma., Ash[END_REF]] concluded that pulmonary rehabilitation improves lung function, quality of life, exercise capacity, asthma control, and reduces the use of rescue medication.

# Airway clearance

The guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in adults [] recommends airway clearance for patients with asthma who are not using inhaled medication, or are not using inhaled medication for more than three months.

Airway clearance is the removal of airway secretions by physiotherapy, and includes airway suctioning, airway clearance techniques, and the use of chest physiotherapy.

The guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in adults [] recommends airway suctioning for patients with asthma who are not using inhaled medication, or are not using inhaled medication for more than three months.

The guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in adults [] recommends airway clearance techniques for patients with asthma who are not using inhaled medication, or are not using inhaled medication for more than three months. Airway clearance techniques include the use of mechanical insufflators, positive expiratory pressure devices, and positive expiratory pressure masks.

The guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in adults [] recommends chest physiotherapy for patients with asthma who are not using inhaled medication, or are not using inhaled medication for more than three months. Chest physiotherapy may be used as an alternative to pharmacological treatment.

Airway clearance has been shown to be beneficial in patients with asthma. A systematic review [[START_REF] Airway clearance techniques for asthma., Smith[END_REF]] concluded that airway clearance improves lung function, reduces the need for medication, and reduces the frequency of asthma exacerbations.

# Airway suctioning

The guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in adults [] recommends airway suctioning for patients with asthma who are not using inhaled medication, or are not using inhaled medication for more than three months. Airway suctioning may be used as an alternative to pharmacological treatment.

Airway suctioning is recommended to remove secretions from the airways, prevent airway collapse, and relieve dyspnoea.

Airway suctioning may be performed by the patient or by a healthcare professional.

A Cochrane review [[START_REF] Airway suctioning for asthma., Smith[END_REF]] concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of airway suctioning in patients with asthma.

# Airway clearance techniques

The guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in adults [] recommends airway clearance techniques for patients with asthma who are not using inhaled medication, or are not using inhaled medication for more than three months. Airway clearance techniques include the use of mechanical insufflators, positive expiratory pressure devices, and positive expiratory pressure masks.

A Cochrane review [[START_REF] Airway clearance techniques for asthma., Smith[END_REF]] concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of airway clearance techniques in patients with asthma.

# Positive expiratory pressure devices

The guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in adults [] recommends positive expiratory pressure devices for patients with asthma who are not using inhaled medication, or are not using inhaled medication for more than three months. Positive expiratory pressure devices may be used as an alternative to pharmacological treatment.

Positive expiratory pressure devices use a pressure gradient to force secretions away from the airways.

A Cochrane review [[START_REF] Airway clearance techniques for asthma., Smith[END_REF]] concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of positive expiratory pressure devices in patients with asthma.

# Positive expiratory pressure masks

Positive expiratory pressure masks may be used as an alternative to pharmacological treatment.

Positive expiratory pressure masks use positive pressure to force secretions away from the airways.

A Cochrane review [[START_REF] Airway clearance techniques for asthma., Smith[END_REF]] concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of positive expiratory pressure masks in patients with asthma.

# Chest physiotherapy

The guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in adults [] recommends chest physiotherapy for patients with asthma who are not using inhaled medication, or are not using inhaled medication for more than three months. Chest physiotherapy may be used as an alternative to pharmacological treatment.

Chest physiotherapy is a type of airway clearance that uses manual or mechanical techniques to mobilise and clear secretions from the airways.

A Cochrane review [[START_REF] Airway clearance techniques for asthma., Smith[END_REF]] concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of chest physiotherapy in patients with asthma.

# Breathing exercises

The guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in adults [] recommends breathing exercises for patients with asthma who are not using inhaled medication, or are not using inhaled medication for more than three months. Breathing exercises may be used as an alternative to pharmacological treatment.

Breathing exercises include pursed lip breathing, diaphragmatic breathing, autogenic drainage, and slow breathing.

CD011913.pub3,Immediate versus delayed postpartum insertion of contraceptive implant and IUD for contraception,2022,October,27,3,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011913.pub3,Fertility Regulation,Gynaecology,"Background
Long‐acting reversible contraception (LARC), including intrauterine devices (IUDs) and contraceptive implants, are highly effective, reversible methods of contraception. Providing LARC methods during the postpartum period is important to support contraceptive choice, and to prevent unintended pregnancy and short interpregnancy intervals. Delaying offering contraception to postpartum people until the first comprehensive postpartum visit, traditionally at around six weeks postpartum, may put some postpartum people at risk of unintended pregnancy, either due to loss to follow‐up or because of initiation of sexual intercourse prior to receiving contraception. Therefore, immediate provision of highly effective contraception, prior to discharge from hospital, has the potential to improve contraceptive use and prevent unintended pregnancies and short interpregnancy intervals.

Objectives
To compare the initiation rate, utilization rates (at six months and 12 months after delivery), effectiveness, and adverse effects of immediate versus delayed postpartum insertion of implants and IUDs for contraception.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and POPLINE for eligible studies up to December 2020. We examined review articles and contacted investigators. We checked registers of ongoing clinical trials, citation lists of included studies, key textbooks, grey literature, and previous systematic reviews for potentially relevant studies.

Selection criteria
We sought randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared immediate postpartum versus delayed insertion of contraceptive implant and IUDs for contraception.

Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (JS, SK) independently screened titles and abstracts of the search results, and assessed the full‐text articles of potentially relevant studies for inclusion. They extracted data from the included studies, assessed risk of bias, compared results, and resolved disagreements by consulting a third review author (PL, SA or PP). We contacted investigators for additional data, where possible. We computed the Mantel‐Haenszel or inverse variance risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for binary outcomes and the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous variables.

Main results
In this updated review, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria; five were studies of contraceptive implants (715 participants) and 11 were studies of IUDs (1894 participants). We identified 12 ongoing studies. We applied GRADE judgements to our results; the overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome ranged from moderate to very low, with the main limitations being risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision.

Contraceptive implants

Immediate insertion probably improves the initiation rate for contraceptive implants compared with delayed insertion (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.98; 5 studies, 715 participants; I2 = 95%; moderate‐certainty evidence).

We are uncertain if there was a difference between the two groups for the utilization rate of contraceptive implants at six months after delivery (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.50; 3 studies, 330 participants; I2 = 89%; very low‐certainty evidence) or at 12 months after insertion (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.04; 2 studies, 164 participants; I2 = 0%; very low‐certainty evidence).

People who received an immediate postpartum contraceptive implant insertion may have had a higher mean number of days of prolonged vaginal bleeding within six weeks postpartum (mean difference (MD) 2.98 days, 95% CI ‐2.71 to 8.66; 2 studies, 420 participants; I2 = 91%; low‐certainty evidence) and a higher rate of other adverse effects in the first six weeks after birth (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.38 to 3.06; 1 study, 215 participants; low‐certainty evidence) than those who received a delayed postpartum insertion. We are uncertain if there was a difference between the two groups for prolonged bleeding at six months after delivery (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.29 to 4.94; 2 studies, 252 participants; I2 = 0%; very low‐certainty evidence).

There may be little or no difference between the two groups for rates of unintended pregnancy at six months (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.08; one study, 205 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether there was a difference in rates of unintended pregnancy at 12 months postpartum (RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.38 to 8.71; 1 study, 64 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference between the two groups for any breastfeeding rates at six months (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01; 2 studies, 225 participants; I2 = 48%; low‐certainty evidence).

IUDs

Immediate insertion of IUDs probably improves the initiation rate compared with delayed insertion, regardless of type of IUD (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.51; 10 studies, 1894 participants; I2 = 98%; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, people who received an immediate postpartum IUD insertion may have had a higher expulsion rate at six months after delivery (RR 4.55, 95% CI 2.52 to 8.19; 8 studies, 1206 participants; I2 = 31%; low‐certainty evidence) than those who received a delayed postpartum insertion.

We are uncertain if there was a difference between the two groups in the utilization of IUDs at six months after insertion (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.62; 6 studies, 971 participants; I2 = 96%; very low‐certainty evidence) or at 12 months after insertion (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.47; 3 studies, 796 participants; I2 = 92%; very low‐certainty evidence).

Immediate IUDs insertion may reduce unintended pregnancy at 12 months (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.41; 1 study, 1000 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether there was difference in any breastfeeding rates at six months in people receiving progestin‐releasing IUDs (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.30; 5 studies, 435 participants; I2 = 54%; very low‐certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions
Evidence from this updated review indicates that immediate postpartum insertion improves the initiation rate of both contraceptive implants and IUDs by the first postpartum visit compared to delayed insertion. However, it is not clear whether that there are differences in utilization rates at six and 12 months postpartum. We are uncertain whether there is any difference in the unintended pregnancy rate at 12 months. Provision of progestin‐releasing implants and IUDs immediately postpartum may have little or no negative impact on breastfeeding. However, the expulsion rate of IUDs and prolonged vaginal bleeding associated with immediate implants appears to be higher.","Is it better to insert an implant or intrauterine device (coil) for contraception within days of childbirth or wait 4 to 6 weeks?
When we use the term 'people' in this summary, we mean individuals with a current ability to become pregnant.

Key messages

‐ Insertion of contraceptive implants or intrauterine devices (IUDs) within days of childbirth (immediate insertion, while in hospital), rather than waiting 4 to 6 weeks for insertion (delayed insertion), increases the number of people in whom they are inserted.

‐ Timing of insertion makes little or no difference to the number of people who use these methods of contraception 6 or 12 months after childbirth.

‐ Expulsion of IUDs seems to occur more frequently in people who have immediate insertion.

‐ Further research is needed about the rates of unintended pregnancy with both immediate insertion and delayed insertion of implants and IUDs.

What are contraceptive implants or intrauterine devices?

Contraceptive implant and intrauterine devices (IUDs) are highly effective methods of birth control that are reversible and safe for use shortly after childbirth. Implants are inserted into the upper arm, and IUDs into the womb (uterus) by doctors or nurses. People who use these methods of contraception use either an implant or an IUD.

Appropriate spacing of pregnancies is good for the health of both pregnant people and newborn babies. Normally, contraception is provided at the first comprehensive health visit after childbirth (usually around six weeks after giving birth). However, some people have sex before this visit, or do not attend it, which increases the risk of unplanned pregnancy. Insertion of a contraceptive implant or IUD within days of childbirth, before discharge from hospital, is convenient for patients and medical staff. The person having the implant or IUD is known not to be pregnant, and this practice may increase the number of people who are able to use these contraception methods.

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to find out if inserting contraceptive implants or IUDs within days of childbirth was better than waiting 6 to 8 weeks for:

‐ the number of people who agreed to insertion (insertion rate);

‐ the number of people who continued to use these contraception methods (utilization rate);

‐ preventing pregnancy; and

‐ whether insertion of contraceptive implants or IUDs within days of childbirth was associated with any unwanted effects.

What did we do?

We searched for studies that investigated insertion of contraceptive implants or IUDs in people within days of childbirth ('immediate insertion') compared to insertion 6 to 8 weeks after childbirth ('delayed' insertion).

We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.

What did we find?

We found 16 studies that involved a total of 2609 people (715 people in contraceptive implant studies, and 1894 people in IUD studies). All studies were conducted in hospitals. Most took place in the USA, but others took place in Uganda, Eygpt, Brazil and Sri Lanka. The studies included people who had just given birth, most of whom were 18 years old or older, though 1 study included younger people. The studies investigated different types of contraceptive implants and IUDs.

Main results

Contraceptive implants

People were 48% more likely to have contraceptive implants inserted when they could be inserted within days of childbirth compared to delayed insertion.

The timing of insertion made little or no difference to the number of people using contraceptive implants 6 or 12 months after childbirth.

Vaginal bleeding seemed to last longer in people who had implants inserted a few days after childbirth compared to delayed insertion (3 days more bleeding), but there was no difference between groups for bleeding 6 months after childbirth.

We are uncertain if there was a difference in rates of unintended pregnancy between the groups at 6 and 12 months after childbirth.

IUDs

People were 27% more likely to have IUDs inserted when they could be inserted within days of childbirth compared to delayed insertion.

It was unclear whether the timing of insertion made any difference to the number of people using IUDs 6 or 12 months after childbirth.

Six months after childbirth, expulsion of IUDs from the womb seemed to occur more frequently in people who had had an IUD inserted within days of childbirth.

We are uncertain if there was a difference in rates of unintended pregnancy between the groups at 6 and 12 months after childbirth.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

Our confidence in the evidence for the different results ranges from moderate to uncertain. This is because people in the studies were aware of when their implants or IUDs were inserted, which may have affected reporting of some outcomes, and because of the dropout rate from the studies. Also, not all of the studies provided data about everything in which we were interested, which meant some results are based on a lower number of people.

How up to date is this evidence?

The evidence is up to date to December 2020.","Title: Immediate versus delayed postpartum insertion of contraceptive implant and IUD for contraception

Abstract: Contraceptive implants are effective long-acting reversible contraceptives. They have the advantage of requiring only one visit for insertion and removal. However, the rate of unintended pregnancy is still high, especially among adolescents. Immediate postpartum insertion of implants may be an option to reduce unintended pregnancy and to improve family planning uptake in the first year postpartum. A Cochrane review in 2013 found that immediate postpartum insertion of implants did not reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy compared to delayed postpartum insertion of implants. This updated Cochrane review included four studies, which were published between 2013 and 2018. The authors concluded that immediate postpartum insertion of contraceptive implants is not associated with a reduction in unintended pregnancy, but is associated with a lower uptake of long-acting reversible contraceptives in the first year postpartum.

CD013740.pub2,Mindfulness‐based psychological interventions for improving mental well‐being in medical students and junior doctors,2021,December,10,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013740.pub2,Common Mental Disorders,Health & safety at work,"Background
Mindfulness interventions are increasingly popular as an approach to improve mental well‐being. To date, no Cochrane Review examines the effectiveness of mindfulness in medical students and junior doctors. Thus, questions remain regarding the efficacy of mindfulness interventions as a preventative mechanism in this population, which is at high risk for poor mental health. 

Objectives
To assess the effects of psychological interventions with a primary focus on mindfulness on the mental well‐being and academic performance of medical students and junior doctors.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and five other databases (to October 2021) and conducted grey literature searches. 

Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of mindfulness that involved medical students of any year level and junior doctors in postgraduate years one, two or three. We included any psychological intervention with a primary focus on teaching the fundamentals of mindfulness as a preventative intervention. Our primary outcomes were anxiety and depression, and our secondary outcomes included stress, burnout, academic performance, suicidal ideation and quality of life. 

Data collection and analysis
We used standard methods as recommended by Cochrane, including Cochrane's risk of bias 2 tool (RoB2). 

Main results
We included 10 studies involving 731 participants in quantitative analysis. 

Compared with waiting‐list control or no intervention, mindfulness interventions did not result in a substantial difference immediately post‐intervention for anxiety (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.09, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.52; P = 0.67, I2 = 57%; 4 studies, 255 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Converting the SMD back to the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale 21‐item self‐report questionnaire (DASS‐21) showed an estimated effect size which is unlikely to be clinically important. Similarly, there was no substantial difference immediately post‐intervention for depression (SMD 0.06, 95% CI ‐0.19 to 0.31; P = 0.62, I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 250 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Converting the SMD back to DASS‐21 showed an estimated effect size which is unlikely to be clinically important. No studies reported longer‐term assessment of the impact of mindfulness interventions on these outcomes. 

For the secondary outcomes, the meta‐analysis showed a small, substantial difference immediately post‐intervention for stress, favouring the mindfulness intervention (SMD ‐0.36, 95% CI ‐0.60 to ‐0.13; P < 0.05, I2 = 33%; 8 studies, 474 participants; low‐certainty evidence); however, this difference is unlikely to be clinically important. The meta‐analysis found no substantial difference immediately post‐intervention for burnout (SMD ‐0.42, 95% CI ‐0.84 to 0.00; P = 0.05, I² = 0%; 3 studies, 91 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The meta‐analysis found a small, substantial difference immediately post‐intervention for academic performance (SMD ‐0.60, 95% CI ‐1.05 to ‐0.14; P < 0.05, I² = 0%; 2 studies, 79 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); however, this difference is unlikely to be clinically important. Lastly, there was no substantial difference immediately post‐intervention for quality of life (mean difference (MD) 0.02, 95% CI ‐0.28 to 0.32; 1 study, 167 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There were no data available for three pre‐specified outcomes of this review: deliberate self‐harm, suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviour.

We assessed the certainty of evidence to range from low to very low across all outcomes. Across most outcomes, we most frequently judged the risk of bias as having 'some concerns'. There were no studies with a low risk of bias across all domains. 

Authors' conclusions
The effectiveness of mindfulness in our target population remains unconfirmed. There have been relatively few studies of mindfulness interventions for junior doctors and medical students. The available studies are small, and we have some concerns about their risk of bias. Thus, there is not much evidence on which to draw conclusions on effects of mindfulness interventions in this population. There was no evidence to determine the effects of mindfulness in the long term. ","Mindfulness for improving mental well‐being in medical students and junior doctors
Why is this review important?

The medical profession is recognised for its challenging and demanding nature. Medical students and junior doctors have been identified as having increased personal and professional stressors during their years of training. As a result, they face increased strain on their mental well‐being. It is important that this group is supported in their mental well‐being to ensure an overall balance in health, as well as to aid their responsibilities of patient care and patient safety. Furthermore, medical students and junior doctors are often time‐poor. Therefore, it is important to establish whether mindfulness is an effective intervention which justifies its time commitment. There are no previous Cochrane Reviews examining mindfulness in our target population. 

Who will be interested in this review?

Medical students and junior doctors; other medical professionals at different levels of training and expertise; and institutions such as universities and hospitals involved in the education and training of medical students. 

What question does this review aim to answer?

What effects do mindfulness‐based psychological interventions have on the mental well‐being of medical students and junior doctors?

Which studies were included in this review?

We searched databases to find all studies of mindfulness in medical students and junior doctors published up to October 2021. In order to be included in this review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to groups using a random method). Studies needed to include medical students from any year level or junior doctors in postgraduate years one, two or three. We did not exclude any studies based on participants' age, nationality or pre‐existing health conditions. We included 10 studies with a total of 731 participants in the analysis. 

What does the evidence from the review tell us?

Overall, we did not identify any evidence of an effect of mindfulness‐based interventions on anxiety or depression symptoms. However, mindfulness‐based interventions appeared to have a small positive effect on stress and a borderline positive effect on burnout. We were unable to report if mindfulness‐based interventions had any effect on deliberate self‐harm, suicidal ideation or suicidal behaviour as no studies examined these outcomes. Lastly, as many studies lacked longer‐term follow‐up of participants, it is not possible to comment on the long‐term effects of mindfulness in medical students and junior doctors. 

We rated the overall certainty of evidence as 'low' or 'very low'. 

What should happen next?

While there were no strong positive findings from the review, some results regarding mindfulness and stress outcomes suggest that there needs to be further research into mindfulness. Any future research should be rigorously designed, and ideally, include assessments of the longer‐term impact of mindfulness.  ","Title: Mindfulness‐based psychological interventions for improving mental well‐being in medical students and junior doctors

Abstract: Mental well‐being has been identified as a key priority for medical education and training.

Around a third of people with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness will be a parent. Both the parents and the children in this population are at increased risk of adverse outcomes due to parental mental illness. Parenting interventions are known to improve parenting skills and decrease child disruptive behaviour. This systematic review aimed to synthesise the evidence base for parenting interventions designed specifically for parents who have schizophrenia or related serious mental illness.

Objectives
To assess the effects of parenting interventions for people with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness.

Search methods
On 10 February 2021 we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials, which is based on the following: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), ClinicalTrials.Gov, Embase, International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN), MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.

Selection criteria
Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared parenting interventions with a control condition for people with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness with a child between the ages of 0 and 18 years.

Data collection and analysis
We independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data and appraised study quality. We assessed risk of bias for included studies.

Main results
We only included one trial (n = 50), and it was not possible to extract any data because the authors did not provide any means and standard deviations for our outcomes of interest; they only reported whether outcomes were significant or not at the 0.05 level. Three domains of the trial were rated as having a high risk of bias.

Authors' conclusions
The only included trial provided inconclusive evidence. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations to people with schizophrenia (or related serious mental illness) or clinicians, or for policy changes. Although there is no RCT evidence, parenting interventions for people with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness have been developed. Future research should test these in RCTs in order to improve the evidence base for this population.","Parenting programmes for parents with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness
Review question

How effective are parenting programmes for people with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness?

Background

Around one third of people with schizophrenia are a parent. Parenting programmes aim to provide support and training for parents to help manage their child's behaviour. Targeted parenting programmes for this group could have a positive effect for both the parents and their children. This review aimed to gather the current evidence for parenting programmes for people with schizophrenia or related mental illness to understand whether such support is effective at improving parenting skills or parent‐child interaction.

Searching

We ran an electronic search in March 2020 and February 2021 for randomised controlled trials of parenting programmes aimed at people with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness. We found 36 studies and checked these to see if they were relevant to our research.

Available evidence

One trial met the review requirements but did not provide usable data. Therefore, there is not enough robust evidence to know anything about the effectiveness of parenting programmes for people with schizophrenia or related mental illness.

Conclusions

There is not enough evidence to make recommendations about parenting programmes for people with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness. Future research should conduct rigorous studies to test the effectiveness of parenting programmes that have already been designed.","Title: Parenting interventions for people with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness

Abstract: Background People with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness (SMI) are at increased risk of parenting problems, which may impact negatively on children's developmental outcomes. The aim of this review is to identify and synthesise the effectiveness of parenting interventions for people with schizophrenia or related SMI, as well as for their children. Methods We searched Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, ERIC and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), and reference lists of identified articles, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Studies were eligible if they were RCTs of parenting interventions for parents with schizophrenia or related SMI, with or without children. Studies were not limited by language, year of publication or publication status. Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted independently by two reviewers. Meta-analyses were conducted using random effects models, and results were reported as standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results The search identified 10 eligible studies, including four RCTs with children (1039 participants). One RCT (239 participants) compared a parenting intervention with treatment as usual. The other RCTs (700 participants) compared parenting interventions with waitlist controls or no treatment. Results from the meta-analysis suggest that parenting interventions are more effective than treatment as usual (SMD=0.46, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.77), and more effective than waitlist controls (SMD=0.54, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.89). However, the studies were not sufficiently homogenous to provide robust conclusions. Conclusions The findings of this review indicate that parenting interventions may be effective in improving parenting behaviour for parents with schizophrenia or related SMI, and may improve children's developmental outcomes. However, further research is required to determine the optimum parenting intervention, the effect on parenting behaviour and children's developmental outcomes, and the long-term effectiveness of interventions.</s>","# Parenting interventions for people with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness

A systematic review of 20 studies [[START_REF] Parenting interventions for people with serious mental illness: a systematic review and meta-analysis, Faulkner[END_REF]] included in this Special Issue examined the effectiveness of parenting interventions for people with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness.

CD013649.pub2,Drugs to reduce bleeding and transfusion in major open vascular or endovascular surgery: a systematic review and network meta‐analysis,2023,February,17,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013649.pub2,Vascular,Heart & circulation,"Background
Vascular surgery may be followed by internal bleeding due to inadequate surgical haemostasis, abnormal clotting, or surgical complications. Bleeding ranges from minor, with no transfusion requirement, to massive, requiring multiple blood product transfusions. There are a number of drugs, given systemically or applied locally, which may reduce the need for blood transfusion.

Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of anti‐fibrinolytic and haemostatic drugs and agents in reducing bleeding and the need for blood transfusion in people undergoing major vascular surgery or vascular procedures with a risk of moderate or severe (> 500 mL) blood loss.

Search methods
We searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL, and Transfusion Evidence Library. We also searched the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov trial registries for ongoing and unpublished trials. Searches used a combination of MeSH and free text terms from database inception to 31 March 2022, without restriction on language or publication status.

Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults of drug treatments to reduce bleeding due to major vascular surgery or vascular procedures with a risk of moderate or severe blood loss, which used placebo, usual care or another drug regimen as control.

Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were units of red cells transfused and all‐cause mortality. Our secondary outcomes included risk of receiving an allogeneic blood product, risk of reoperation or repeat procedure due to bleeding, risk of a thromboembolic event, risk of a serious adverse event and length of hospital stay. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence.

Main results
We included 22 RCTs with 3393 participants analysed, of which one RCT with 69 participants was reported only in abstract form, with no usable data. Seven RCTs evaluated systemic drug treatments (three aprotinin, two desmopressin, two tranexamic acid) and 15 RCTs evaluated topical drug treatments (drug‐containing bioabsorbable dressings or glues), including fibrin, thrombin, collagen, gelatin, synthetic sealants and one investigational new agent. Most trials were conducted in high‐income countries and the majority of the trials only included participants undergoing elective surgery. We also identified two ongoing RCTs.

We were unable to perform the planned network meta‐analysis due to the sparse reporting of outcomes relevant to this review.

Systemic drug treatments

We identified seven trials of three systemic drugs: aprotinin, desmopressin and tranexamic acid, all with placebo controls. The trials of aprotinin and desmopressin were small with very low‐certainty evidence for all of our outcomes. Tranexamic acid versus placebo was the systemic drug comparison with the largest number of participants (2 trials; 1460 participants), both at low risk of bias. The largest of these included a total of 9535 individuals undergoing a number of different higher risk surgeries and reported limited information on the vascular subgroup (1399 participants).

Neither trial reported the number of units of red cells transfused per participant up to 30 days. Three outcomes were associated with very low‐certainty evidence due to the very wide confidence intervals (CIs) resulting from small study sizes and low number of events. These were: all‐cause mortality up to 30 days; number of participants requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion up to 30 days; and risk of requiring a repeat procedure or operation due to bleeding.

Tranexamic acid may have no effect on the risk of thromboembolic events up to 30 days (risk ratio (RR) 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.36; 1 trial, 1360 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to imprecision).

There is one large ongoing trial (8320 participants) comparing tranexamic acid versus placebo in people undergoing non‐cardiac surgery who are at high risk of requiring a red cell transfusion. This aims to complete recruitment in April 2023. This trial has primary outcomes of proportion of participants transfused with red blood cells and incidence of venous thromboembolism (DVT or PE).

Topical drug treatments

Most trials of topical drug treatments were at high risk of bias due to their open‐label design (compared with usual care, or liquids were compared with sponges). All of the trials were small, most were very small, and few reported clinically relevant outcomes in the postoperative period. Fibrin sealant versus usual care was the topical drug comparison with the largest number of participants (5 trials, 784 participants).

The five trials that compared fibrin sealant with usual care were all at high risk of bias, due to the open‐label trial design with no measures put in place to minimise reporting bias. All of the trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies.

None of the five trials reported the number of red cells transfused per participant up to 30 days or the number of participants requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion up to 30 days.

The other three outcomes were associated with very low‐certainty evidence with wide confidence intervals due to small sample sizes and the low number of events, these were: all‐cause mortality up to 30 days; risk of requiring a repeat procedure due to bleeding; and risk of thromboembolic disease up to 30 days.

We identified one large trial (500 participants) comparing fibrin sealant versus usual care in participants undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, which has not yet started recruitment. This trial lists death due to arterial disease and reintervention rates as primary outcomes.

Authors' conclusions
Because of a lack of data, we are uncertain whether any systemic or topical treatments used to reduce bleeding due to major vascular surgery have an effect on: all‐cause mortality up to 30 days; risk of requiring a repeat procedure or operation due to bleeding; number of red cells transfused per participant up to 30 days or the number of participants requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion up to 30 days.

There may be no effect of tranexamic acid on the risk of thromboembolic events up to 30 days, this is important as there has been concern that this risk may be increased.

Trials with sample size targets of thousands of participants and clinically relevant outcomes are needed, and we look forward to seeing the results of the ongoing trials in the future.","Are there any drugs which help reduce bleeding after surgery on blood vessels?
• Key messages

We do not yet know what the best drugs are to reduce bleeding and blood transfusions during vascular surgery.

• What is vascular surgery?

Vascular surgery is when a surgeon operates on blood vessels, to repair leaks and areas of weakness, or to clear blockages. This review focused on the types of vascular surgery that are more likely to lead to severe bleeding.

• Why is it important to reduce blood transfusions during vascular surgery?

If people bleed a lot during or after this type of surgery they may need blood transfusions to replace the blood they have lost. It is better to avoid receiving a blood transfusion, if possible, because blood transfusions can cause harm. This is especially important when health services have limited blood supplies.

• What did we want to find out?

We wanted to find out which drug treatments help reduce bleeding and the need for blood transfusion. We also wanted to find out if these treatments increase the risk of side effects, such as blood clots.

• What did we do?

We searched electronic libraries for reports of the most reliable studies (called randomised controlled trials) of drugs to prevent bleeding after surgery on blood vessels.

• What did we find?

We found seven trials of drugs injected before surgery to try to reduce the amount of bleeding. We found 15 trials of dressings or glues with drugs in them. These are used to stop bleeding during surgery and are left inside after the operation. We did not find enough information to be sure which drugs are best for reducing bleeding and transfusions during vascular surgery. Often, the people having surgery were not followed up for very long once they left the operating theatre, so we could not find out whether they needed a blood transfusion afterwards.

One trial, of 9535 people having surgery, tested a drug called tranexamic acid injected before surgery. This included 1399 people who had surgery on their blood vessels, but it did not report much information for this group on its own. The one outcome it did report on, specifically for vascular surgery, was whether there was an increased risk of developing a blood clot if tranexamic acid is given. We found that there may be no difference in the risk of developing a blood clot between tranexamic acid and a placebo.

• What are the limitations of the evidence?

Most of the trials we found were small, with fewer than 100 people included. This is not enough to be sure if any of these treatments might help people. We need to have trials with many hundreds or even thousands of people included to find out if these drugs helped them recover from surgery.

Most of the trials we found did not collect information about blood transfusions after surgery. We think this might be for a few different reasons. Surgeons may transfer the care of patients they have operated on to the care of other healthcare professionals if they require prolonged postoperative care, e.g. physicians. It is more complicated to do a study if they need to work with other healthcare professionals to find out what happened afterwards.

Also, most of the trials were run by the companies that make the treatments. It is cheaper and easier for them to only look at what happens during surgery, especially if people will accept their product without any information about what happens after surgery.

• How up to date is this evidence?

We found all the published trials on this topic up to 31 March 2022. We also found all the trials which have started or are going to be starting soon. The good news is that there is one very large trial on drugs to prevent bleeding in surgery that is already in progress. It is testing tranexamic acid injected before surgery. It plans to recruit 8320 people undergoing a range of surgeries, including surgery on blood vessels, and will report the number of people needing blood transfusions. This will be an important result when the trial is completed, and we hope it will inspire other surgeons to do trials of this sort in future.","Title: Drugs to reduce bleeding and transfusion in major open vascular or endovascular surgery: a systematic review and network meta‐analysis

Abstract: Background: Bleeding and blood transfusion are important complications of major vascular surgery, which are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of drugs used to reduce blood loss and blood transfusion requirements in major open vascular and endovascular surgery. 
 
Methods: We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases from inception to June 2018 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of drugs to reduce bleeding and blood transfusion in patients undergoing major vascular surgery. The primary outcomes were total blood loss and blood transfusion. Secondary outcomes were blood loss and blood transfusion in specific time periods, haemodynamic stability, haemodynamic instability, and adverse events. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. 
 
Findings: We included 22 RCTs with 1503 patients (1050 vascular and 453 endovascular). The drugs compared were tranexamic acid (TXA), aprotinin, epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA), recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa), fibrinogen concentrate, and antifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid plus epsilon aminocaproic acid). Compared with placebo, aprotinin reduced total blood loss by 404 mL (95% CI -618 to -191; p=0·0004), and TXA reduced blood loss in the first 24 hours by 1045 mL (95% CI -1414 to -676; p<0·00001). Aprotinin reduced the number of patients receiving a blood transfusion by 44% (95% CI -56 to -31; p<0·00001), and TXA reduced the number of patients receiving a blood transfusion by 26% (95% CI -38 to -14; p<0·00001). There were no significant differences in other secondary outcomes. There was no evidence of small-study effects. 
 
Interpretation: Compared with placebo, aprotinin and TXA reduced blood loss and blood transfusion in patients undergoing major vascular surgery.

Introduction: Bleeding and transfusion rates are often high after major vascular or endovascular surgery. Several drugs have been studied to reduce bleeding and transfusion rates, but their comparative effectiveness has not been assessed. We performed a systematic review and network meta‐analysis to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of drugs to reduce bleeding and transfusion in patients undergoing major open vascular or endovascular surgery.

Methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, MEDLINE and CENTRAL. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of drugs administered in the operating room to reduce bleeding or transfusion in patients undergoing major open vascular or endovascular surgery. The primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality and severe adverse events. Secondary outcomes were bleeding and transfusion. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool. We performed a Bayesian network meta‐analysis and calculated mean differences (MDs) with 95% credible intervals (CrIs).

Results: We included 11 RCTs involving 4958 patients. Tranexamic acid was the only drug that significantly reduced all‐cause mortality compared to placebo (MD 0.05, 95% CrI 0.01 to 0.09). Tranexamic acid, aprotinin, and fibrinogen concentrate were significantly more effective than placebo in reducing bleeding, whereas fibrinogen concentrate was also significantly more effective than tranexamic acid and aprotinin. Tranexamic acid, aprotinin, and fibrinogen concentrate were significantly more effective than placebo in reducing transfusion. Tranexamic acid was the only drug that was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing severe adverse events.

Conclusions: Tranexamic acid was the only drug that significantly reduced all‐cause mortality and bleeding, and was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing transfusion and severe adverse events.

Introduction: The off‐pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) has been a surgical option for coronary artery disease. However, its clinical benefit is still controversial. We aimed to investigate the clinical outcomes of OPCAB compared with on‐pump coronary artery bypass grafting (ONCAB) in a meta‐analysis.

Methods: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception to June 2018. We included studies that compared 30‐day mortality and bleeding between OPCAB and ONCAB. The pooled risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.

Results: A total of 11 studies (11,121 patients) were included in the meta‐analysis. OPCAB was associated with significantly lower 30‐day mortality (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52–0.81, p < 0.001), less transfusion (MD −0.40, 95% CI −0.65 to −0.15, p = 0.002), less blood loss (MD −143.89, 95% CI −221.92 to −65.85, p < 0.001), less mediastinal drainage (MD −150.29, 95% CI −223.42 to −77.16, p < 0.001), less rethoracotomy (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.26–0.62, p < 0.001), less stroke (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.45–0.93, p = 0.02), and less respiratory failure (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.33–0.67, p < 0.001) compared with ONCAB.

Conclusions: OPCAB is associated with significantly lower 30‐day mortality, less transfusion, less blood loss, less mediastinal drainage, less rethoracotomy, less stroke, and less respiratory failure compared with ONCAB.

Introduction: Tranexamic acid (TXA) has been widely used to reduce bleeding and allogeneic blood transfusion (ABT) in different surgical procedures. We aimed to evaluate the effect of TXA on the need for ABT after open heart surgery.

Methods: This was a retrospective study of patients submitted to open heart surgery in a single center between 2011 and 2015. Patients who received TXA and patients who did not were compared regarding the need for ABT. We performed a logistic regression analysis with the need for ABT as the dependent variable and TXA as the independent variable, with adjustment for the propensity score.

Results: A total of 312 patients were included. In the univariate analysis, TXA was associated with lower need for ABT (42% vs. 61%, p = 0.001). The propensity score was 0.61, and in the multivariate analysis, TXA was associated with lower need for ABT (odds ratio [OR] 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23–0.77, p = 0.005).

Conclusions: TXA was associated with lower need for ABT after open heart surgery.

Introduction: Although off‐pump coronary artery bypass surgery (OPCAB) is associated with a lower risk of postoperative bleeding and transfusion, its clinical benefit is still controversial. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is one of the most commonly used agents for reducing bleeding and transfusion. We aimed to investigate the effect of TXA on the clinical outcomes of OPCAB in a meta‐analysis.

Methods: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception to June 2018. We included studies that compared clinical outcomes of OPCAB between patients who received TXA and patients who did not. The pooled risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) with 95%"

Convalescent plasma may reduce mortality in patients with viral respiratory diseases, and is being investigated as a potential therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding benefits and risks of this intervention is required.

Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma transfusion in the treatment of people with COVID‐19; and to maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach.

Search methods
To identify completed and ongoing studies, we searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, and the Epistemonikos COVID‐19 L*OVE Platform. We searched monthly until 03 March 2022.

Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating convalescent plasma for COVID‐19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity.

We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)), as well as studies evaluating standard immunoglobulin.

Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology.

To assess bias in included studies we used RoB 2. We used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of evidence for the following outcomes: all‐cause mortality at up to day 28, worsening and improvement of clinical status (for individuals with moderate to severe disease), hospital admission or death, COVID‐19 symptoms resolution (for individuals with mild disease), quality of life, grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and serious adverse events.

Main results
In this fourth review update version, we included 33 RCTs with 24,861 participants, of whom 11,432 received convalescent plasma. Of these, nine studies are single‐centre studies and 24 are multi‐centre studies. Fourteen studies took place in America, eight in Europe, three in South‐East Asia, two in Africa, two in western Pacific and three in eastern Mediterranean regions and one in multiple regions. We identified a further 49 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma, and 33 studies reporting as being completed.

Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID‐19 and moderate to severe disease

29 RCTs investigated the use of convalescent plasma for 22,728 participants with moderate to severe disease. 23 RCTs with 22,020 participants compared convalescent plasma to placebo or standard care alone, five compared to standard plasma and one compared to human immunoglobulin. We evaluate subgroups on detection of antibodies detection, symptom onset, country income groups and several co‐morbidities in the full text.

Convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone

Convalescent plasma does not reduce all‐cause mortality at up to day 28 (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.03; 220 per 1000; 21 RCTs, 19,021 participants; high‐certainty evidence). It has little to no impact on need for invasive mechanical ventilation, or death (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.11; 296 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 14,477 participants; high‐certainty evidence) and has no impact on whether participants are discharged from hospital (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.02; 665 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 12,721 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may have little to no impact on quality of life (MD 1.00, 95% CI −2.14 to 4.14; 1 RCT, 483 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may have little to no impact on the risk of grades 3 and 4 adverse events (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.42; 212 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 2392 participants; low‐certainty evidence). It has probably little to no effect on the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.44; 135 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 3901 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).

Convalescent plasma versus standard plasma

We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces or increases all‐cause mortality at up to day 28 (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.19; 129 per 1000; 4 RCTs, 484 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces or increases the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, or death (RR 5.59, 95% CI 0.29 to 108.38; 311 per 1000; 1 study, 34 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and whether it reduces or increases the risk of serious adverse events (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.15; 236 per 1000; 3 RCTs, 327 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes.

Convalescent plasma versus human immunoglobulin

Convalescent plasma may have little to no effect on all‐cause mortality at up to day 28 (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.50; 464 per 1000; 1 study, 190 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes.

Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and mild disease

We identified two RCTs reporting on 536 participants, comparing convalescent plasma to placebo or standard care alone, and two RCTs reporting on 1597 participants with mild disease, comparing convalescent plasma to standard plasma.

Convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone

We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces all‐cause mortality at up to day 28 (odds ratio (OR) 0.36, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.46; 8 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 536 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). It may have little to no effect on admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.84; 117 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low‐certainty evidence), on time to COVID‐19 symptom resolution (hazard ratio (HR) 1.05, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.30; 483 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low‐certainty evidence), on the risk of grades 3 and 4 adverse events (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.19; 144 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.94; 133 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes.

Convalescent plasma versus standard plasma

We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces all‐cause mortality at up to day 28 (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.75; 2 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 1597 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). It probably reduces admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.75; 36 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 1595 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may have little to no effect on initial symptom resolution at up to day 28 (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.27; 1 RCT, 416 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes.

This is a living systematic review. We search monthly for new evidence and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence.

Authors' conclusions
For the comparison of convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone, our certainty in the evidence that convalescent plasma for individuals with moderate to severe disease does not reduce mortality and has little to no impact on clinical improvement or worsening is high. It probably has little to no effect on SAEs. For individuals with mild disease, we have low certainty evidence for our primary outcomes. There are 49 ongoing studies, and 33 studies reported as complete in a trials registry. Publication of ongoing studies might resolve some of the uncertainties around convalescent plasma therapy for people with asymptomatic or mild disease.","Is plasma from the blood of people who have recovered from COVID‐19 an effective treatment for other people with COVID‐19?
Key messages

• We are very confident that plasma from the blood of people who have recovered from COVID‐19 (convalescent plasma) has no benefits for the treatment of people with moderate to severe COVID‐19.

• Convalescent plasma may have little to no benefit for treating people with mild COVID‐19.

• We found 49 ongoing studies and 33 finished studies with unpublished results. We will update our review with evidence from these studies as soon as possible. New evidence may answer our remaining questions, especially for people with mild COVID‐19 or who have no symptoms.

What is convalescent plasma?

The body produces antibodies as one of its defences against infection. Antibodies are found in part of the blood called plasma. Plasma from people who have recovered from the COVID‐19 virus contains COVID‐19 antibodies, and it can be used to make convalescent plasma, which is plasma that contains these antibodies.

Convalescent plasma has been used successfully to treat some viruses. This treatment (given by a drip or injection) is generally well‐tolerated, but can cause unwanted effects.

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to find out whether convalescent plasma is an effective treatment for people with confirmed COVID‐19. We looked at:

• deaths from any cause after treatment with convalescent plasma;

• worsening of patients’ condition, measured by the number of people who needed support from a ventilator (a machine that helps people breathe if they cannot breathe on their own) or died; and improvement of patients’ condition, measured by participants discharged from hospital;

• quality of life; and

• unwanted effects.

What did we do?

We searched for studies that investigated convalescent plasma to treat people with COVID‐19. Studies could take place anywhere in the world and include people of any age, gender or ethnicity, with mild, moderate or severe COVID‐19.

Where possible we pooled (added up) the studies’ results to analyse them. We rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.

What did we find?

We found 33 studies with 24,861 participants that investigated convalescent plasma. Among these, 29 studies included people with moderate to severe COVID‐19 and four studies included people with mild COVID‐19. Studies mainly took place in hospitals, in countries all over the world. The following findings apply to convalescent plasma compared with placebo (the same treatment but with no active ingredients) or standard care.

People with moderate to severe COVID‐19

• Convalescent plasma makes no difference to deaths from any cause at up to 28 days after treatment, about 225 in 1000 people died, compared to 220 in 1000 people who had been given convalescent plasma (21 studies, 19,021 people).

• Convalescent plasma makes little to no difference to needing invasive mechanical ventilation or dying. About 287 in 1000 people needed invasive mechanical ventilation support or died, compared to 296 in 1000 people given convalescent plasma (6 studies, 14,477 people). It makes no difference toparticipants being discharged from hospital. About 665 in 1000 people were discharged from hospital, compared to 665 in 1000 people given convalescent plasma (6 studies, 12,721 people).

• Convalescent plasma probably makes no difference to serious unwanted effects, about 118 in 1000 people may be at risk to have serious unwanted effects compared to 133 in 1000 people given convalescent plasma (6 studies, 4901 people).

• Convalescent plasma may result in no difference in quality of life (1 study, 483 people).

People with mild COVID‐19
• Convalescent plasma may result in no difference to deaths from any cause up to 28 days after treatment. About 22 in 1000 people given placebo or standard care died, compared to 9 in 1000 people given convalescent plasma (2 studies, 536 people).

• Convalescent plasma may result in no difference to admission to hospital or death within 28 days after treatment. About 112 in 1000 people given placebo or standard care were admitted to hospital or died, compared to 117 in 1000 people given convalescent plasma (1 study, 376 people).

• Convalescent plasma may result in no difference in the time until COVID‐19 symptoms resolved (1 study, 376 people).

• Convalescent plasma may result in no difference to serious unwanted effects.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

• We are very confident in the evidence for deaths from any cause, and worsening and improvement of patients’ condition in people with moderate to severe COVID‐19, as the results are consistent and are from many high‐quality studies.

• Our confidence in the other evidence for people with moderate and severe, and mild COVID‐19 is still limited, as we could not identify enough consistent results from a lot of studies.

• We still have little evidence on quality of life and for people with mild disease, and none for people without COVID‐19 symptoms.

How up to date is this evidence?

This is the fifth version of our review. The evidence is up to date to 03 March 2022.","Title: Convalescent plasma for people with COVID‐19: a living systematic review

Abstract: We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of convalescent plasma in people with COVID‐19 and assessed their risk of bias, certainty of evidence and effect on outcomes of COVID‐19. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020194769).</s>","# Convalescent plasma for people with COVID‐19: a living systematic review

We have recently completed a living systematic review of the use of convalescent plasma for people with COVID‐19.[START_SUP]1[END_SUP]

The living systematic review methodology is described in more detail in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.[START_SUP]2[END_SUP] The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020199398).

# Inclusion criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non‐randomized controlled trials, quasi‐RCTs, and observational studies. We included all studies that assessed the use of convalescent plasma for people with confirmed COVID‐19 infection.

# Exclusion criteria

We excluded studies in which participants had a suspected or unconfirmed COVID‐19 infection.

# Outcomes

We prespecified outcomes to be reported in the living systematic review, including all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, viral clearance, time to viral clearance, and length of hospital stay. We also prespecified that we would update the review every three months to include new studies.

# Search strategy

We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to 26 June 2020. We updated the search on 22 July 2020 and 29 September 2020. The full search strategy is available in Appendix S1.

# Selection of studies

Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts of all citations identified in the search for eligibility. We obtained full texts of all potentially eligible studies and assessed them for eligibility. We resolved disagreements through discussion.

# Data collection process

Two review authors independently extracted data from all included studies using a data extraction form. We resolved disagreements through discussion.

# Risk of bias assessment

Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias in included RCTs using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool[START_SUP]3[END_SUP] and in included non‐randomized studies using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale.[START_SUP]4[END_SUP]

# Data synthesis

We conducted a random‐effects meta‐analysis for the outcomes of all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, and viral clearance, using Review Manager 5.3.[START_SUP]5[END_SUP] We calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. We did not pool results for the outcomes of time to viral clearance and length of hospital stay because these outcomes were reported as median and range in most studies. We conducted a subgroup analysis of studies that used high‐titer convalescent plasma.

# Results

We included 12 studies in the living systematic review, including 11 RCTs and one non‐randomized controlled trial (Figure 1).[START_SUP]6[END_SUP], [START_SUP]7[END_SUP], [START_SUP]8[END_SUP], [START_SUP]9[END_SUP], [START_SUP]10[END_SUP], [START_SUP]11[END_SUP], [START_SUP]12[END_SUP], [START_SUP]13[END_SUP], [START_SUP]14[END_SUP], [START_SUP]15[END_SUP], [START_SUP]16[END_SUP] The characteristics of included studies are shown in Table 1. The studies included a total of 2193 participants, including 1055 participants in the intervention group and 1138 participants in the control group.

# Risk of bias in included studies

The risk of bias in the included RCTs is shown in Figure 2. All RCTs were judged to be at high risk of bias due to inadequate generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, and blinding of participants and personnel. The non‐randomized controlled trial was judged to be at high risk of bias due to confounding and incomplete outcome data.

CD005562.pub3,Cognitive stimulation to improve cognitive functioning in people with dementia,2023,January,31,3,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD005562.pub3,Dementia and Cognitive Improvement,Mental health,"Background
Cognitive stimulation (CS) is an intervention for people with dementia offering a range of enjoyable activities providing general stimulation for thinking, concentration and memory, usually in a social setting, such as a small group. CS is distinguished from other approaches such as cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation by its broad focus and social elements, aiming to improve domains such as quality of life (QoL) and mood as well as cognitive function.

Recommended in various guidelines and widely implemented internationally, questions remain regarding different modes of delivery and the clinical significance of any benefits. A systematic review of CS is important to clarify its effectiveness and place practice recommendations on a sound evidence base. This review was last updated in 2012.

Objectives
To evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of CS for people with dementia, including any negative effects, on cognition and other relevant outcomes, accounting where possible for differences in its implementation.

Search methods
We identified trials from a search of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, last searched on 3 March 2022. We used the search terms: cognitive stimulation, reality orientation, memory therapy, memory groups, memory support, memory stimulation, global stimulation, cognitive psychostimulation. We performed supplementary searches in a number of major healthcare databases and trial registers to ensure the search was up‐to‐date and comprehensive.

Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CS for dementia published in peer review journals in the English language incorporating a measure of cognitive change.

Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. As CS is a psychosocial intervention, we did not expect those receiving or delivering CS to be blinded to the nature of the intervention. Where necessary, we contacted study authors requesting data not provided in the papers. Where appropriate, we undertook subgroup analysis by modality (individual versus group), number of sessions and frequency, setting (community versus care home), type of control condition and dementia severity. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall quality of evidence for each outcome.

Main results
We included 37 RCTs (with 2766 participants), 26 published since the previous update. Most evaluated CS groups; eight examined individual CS. Participants' median age was 79.7 years. Sixteen studies included participants resident in care homes or hospitals. Study quality showed indications of improvement since the previous review, with few areas of high risk of bias. Assessors were clearly blinded to treatment allocation in most studies (81%) and most studies (81%) reported use of a treatment manual by those delivering the intervention. However, in a substantial number of studies (59%), we could not find details on all aspects of the randomisation procedures, leading us to rate the risk of selection bias as unclear.

We entered data in the meta‐analyses from 36 studies (2704 participants; CS: 1432, controls: 1272). The primary analysis was on changes evident immediately following the treatment period (median length 10 weeks; range 4 to 52 weeks). Only eight studies provided data allowing evaluation of whether effects were subsequently maintained (four at 6‐ to 12‐week follow‐up; four at 8‐ to 12‐month follow‐up). No negative effects were reported. Overall, we found moderate‐quality evidence for a small benefit in cognition associated with CS (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.40, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.55). In the 25 studies, with 1893 participants, reporting the widely used MMSE (Mini‐Mental State Examination) test for cognitive function in dementia, there was moderate‐quality evidence of a clinically important difference of 1.99 points between CS and controls (95% CI: 1.24, 2.74).

In secondary analyses, with smaller total sample sizes, again examining the difference between CS and controls on changes immediately following the intervention period, we found moderate‐quality evidence of a slight improvement in self‐reported QoL (18 studies, 1584 participants; SMD: 0.25 [95% CI: 0.07, 0.42]) as well as in QoL ratings made by proxies (staff or caregivers). We found high‐quality evidence for clinically relevant improvements in staff/interviewer ratings of communication and social interaction (5 studies, 702 participants; SMD: 0.53 [95% CI: 0.36, 0.70]) and for slight benefits in instrumental Activities of Daily Living, self‐reported depressed mood, staff/interviewer‐rated anxiety and general behaviour rating scales. We found moderate‐quality evidence for slight improvements in behaviour that challenges and in basic Activities of Daily Living and low‐quality evidence for a slight improvement in staff/interviewer‐rated depressed mood. A few studies reported a range of outcomes for family caregivers. We found moderate‐quality evidence that overall CS made little or no difference to caregivers' mood or anxiety.

We found a high level of inconsistency between studies in relation to both cognitive outcomes and QoL. In exploratory subgroup analyses, we did not identify an effect of modality (group versus individual) or, for group studies, of setting (community versus care home), total number of group sessions or type of control condition (treatment‐as‐usual versus active controls). However, we did find improvements in cognition were larger where group sessions were more frequent (twice weekly or more versus once weekly) and where average severity of dementia among participants at the start of the intervention was 'mild' rather than 'moderate'. Imbalance in numbers of studies and participants between subgroups and residual inconsistency requires these exploratory findings to be interpreted cautiously.

Authors' conclusions
In this updated review, now with a much more extensive evidence base, we have again identified small, short‐term cognitive benefits for people with mild to moderate dementia participating in CS programmes. From a smaller number of studies, we have also found clinically relevant improvements in communication and social interaction and slight benefits in a range of outcomes including QoL, mood and behaviour that challenges. There are relatively few studies of individual CS, and further research is needed to delineate the effectiveness of different delivery methods (including digital and remote, individual and group) and of multi‐component programmes. We have identified that the frequency of group sessions and level of dementia severity may influence the outcomes of CS, and these aspects should be studied further. There remains an evidence gap in relation to the potential benefits of longer‐term CS programmes and their clinical significance.","Can cognitive stimulation benefit people with dementia?
Key messages

‐ For people with mild‐to‐moderate dementia, cognitive stimulation probably leads to small benefits in cognition (the general ability to think and remember).

‐ We found a range of other probable benefits, including improved well‐being, mood and day‐to‐day abilities, but benefits were generally slight and, especially for cognition and well‐being, varied greatly between studies.

‐ Most studies evaluated group cognitive stimulation. Future studies should try to clarify the effects of individual cognitive stimulation, assess how often group sessions should take place to have the best effect, and identify who benefits most from cognitive stimulation.

What is dementia?

Dementia is an umbrella term for numerous brain disorders. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common of these. People of all ages can develop dementia, but most often it occurs in later life. People with dementia typically experience a decline in their cognitive abilities, which can impair memory, thinking, language and practical skills. These problems usually worsen over time and can lead to isolation, upset and distress for the person with dementia and those providing care and support.

Cognitive stimulation

Cognitive stimulation (CS) is a form of 'mental exercise' developed specifically to help people with dementia. It involves a wide range of activities aiming to stimulate thinking and memory generally, including discussion of past and present events and topics of interest, word games, puzzles, music and creative practical activities. Usually delivered by trained staff working with a small group of people with dementia for around 45 minutes twice‐weekly, it can also be provided on a one‐to‐one basis. Some programmes have trained family carers to provide CS to their relative.

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to find out if CS was better for people living with dementia than usual care or unstructured social activities to improve:

‐ cognitive abilities (including memory, thinking and language skills)

‐ well‐being and mood

‐ day‐to‐day abilities

‐ distress and upset for the person with dementia and/or carers

We also wanted to find out if family carers experienced any changes associated with the person with dementia receiving CS or if there were any unwanted effects.

What did we do?
We searched for studies that looked at group or individual CS compared with usual care or unstructured social activity in people living with dementia.

We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.

What did we find?

We found 37 studies involving 2766 participants with mild or moderate dementia and an average age of 79 years. The biggest study involved 356 participants, the smallest 13. The studies were conducted in 17 countries from five continents, with most in Europe. Fewer than half (16) included participants living in care homes or hospitals. The length of the trials varied from four weeks to two years. Sessions per week varied from one to six. The overall number of sessions varied from eight to 520. Most studies lasted for around 10 weeks, with around 20 sessions. Most studies offered CS in groups, with just eight examining individual CS.

Main results

No negative effects were reported. We found that CS probably results in a small benefit to cognition at the end of the course of sessions compared with usual care/unstructured activities. This benefit equates roughly to a six‐month delay in the cognitive decline usually expected in mild‐to‐moderate dementia. We found preliminary evidence suggesting that cognition benefited more when group sessions occurred twice weekly or more (rather than once weekly) and that benefits were greater in studies where participants’ dementia at the outset was of mild severity.

We also found that participants improved on measures of communication and social interaction and showed slight benefits in day‐to‐day activities and in their own ratings of their mood. There is probably also a slight improvement in participants’ well‐being and in experiences that are upsetting and distressing for people with dementia and carers. We found CS probably made little or no difference to carers' mood or anxiety.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about differences in results between studies. We cannot be certain of the exact reasons for these differences, but we noted that studies varied in:

• the way CS was delivered (individually, in groups, using an app) and the programme of activities included

• who delivered the programme (trained professionals, care workers, family carers)

• the frequency of sessions (1 per week to 5 per week)

• the duration of the programme (from 4 weeks to 1 or 2 years)

• the type(s) of dementia with which participants were diagnosed and the severity of the dementia

• whether participants lived in care homes and hospitals or in their own homes

We were unable to examine as many of these sources of potential difference as would have been desirable because of the relatively small number of studies reflecting each aspect.

How up‐to‐date is this evidence?

This review updates our previous review from 2012, with evidence up‐to‐date to March 2022.","Title: Cognitive stimulation to improve cognitive functioning in people with dementia

Abstract: Background: The number of people with dementia is increasing as the population ages. Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is a non-pharmacological treatment which aims to improve cognitive functioning in people with dementia. CST can be used as an adjunctive treatment alongside drug therapy. Aim: To review the evidence for the use of CST in people with dementia. Methods: The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline and Embase were searched. Trials which used CST as an adjunctive treatment to drug therapy in people with dementia were included. Data were extracted on the methods used, the participants and the outcomes. The trials were assessed for methodological quality and heterogeneity. Results: A total of 10 trials were included. These trials compared CST to no treatment, other treatment or treatment as usual. There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the effects of CST on global cognition or activities of daily living. CST had a significant positive effect on quality of life in people with dementia and a significant negative effect on the caregiver burden. Conclusion: CST is a useful adjunctive treatment in people with dementia. However, further high-quality research is needed to determine the most effective ways of delivering CST and to identify those who are most likely to benefit from it.</s>","# Cognitive stimulation to improve cognitive functioning in people with dementia

# Cognitive stimulation interventions

Cognitive stimulation interventions are designed to improve cognitive functioning in people with dementia. This can be achieved by providing them with a range of cognitive tasks or activities that engage their memory, language, reasoning and other cognitive skills [[START_REF] The effects of a computer-based cognitive training program in healthy older adults: A pilot study, González-Palau[END_REF]]. Cognitive stimulation is not a treatment for dementia, but rather a strategy that can be used to delay the onset or slow the progression of dementia [[START_REF] Cognitive stimulation to improve cognitive functioning in people with dementia., Woods[END_REF]]. Cognitive stimulation has been used to support people with dementia in a variety of settings, including in the home, in day centres and in the community [[START_REF] Cognitive stimulation to improve cognitive functioning in people with dementia., Woods[END_REF]].

# The effects of cognitive stimulation interventions on cognition

The effects of cognitive stimulation interventions on cognition have been widely investigated. The majority of the evidence comes from small-scale randomised controlled trials, with a limited number of studies of higher methodological quality. A review of 11 randomised controlled trials concluded that cognitive stimulation can improve cognitive functioning in people with dementia [[START_REF] Cognitive stimulation to improve cognitive functioning in people with dementia., Woods[END_REF]]. This review also found that cognitive stimulation interventions that include a combination of tasks, activities and activities of daily living are more effective than those that include only tasks or activities of daily living. However, there is also some evidence that cognitive stimulation may not have any effect on cognition in people with dementia. In a recent randomised controlled trial, participants in the cognitive stimulation intervention group did not show any improvement in cognition compared to the control group [[START_REF] Cognitive stimulation to improve cognitive functioning in people with dementia., Woods[END_REF]]. The authors attributed this finding to the small sample size and the low intensity of the cognitive stimulation intervention [[START_REF] Cognitive stimulation to improve cognitive functioning in people with dementia., Woods[END_REF]].

MR000050.pub2,Control interventions in randomised trials among people with mental health disorders,2022,April,4,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.MR000050.pub2,Methodology,Methodology,"Background
Control interventions in randomised trials provide a frame of reference for the experimental interventions and enable estimations of causality. In the case of randomised trials assessing patients with mental health disorders, many different control interventions are used, and the choice of control intervention may have considerable impact on the estimated effects of the treatments being evaluated.

Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of typical control interventions in randomised trials with patients with mental health disorders. The difference in effects between control interventions translates directly to the impact a control group has on the estimated effect of an experimental intervention. We aimed primarily to assess the difference in effects between (i) wait‐list versus no‐treatment, (ii) usual care versus wait‐list or no‐treatment, and (iii) placebo interventions (all placebo interventions combined or psychological, pharmacological, and physical placebos individually) versus wait‐list or no‐treatment. Wait‐list patients are offered the experimental intervention by the researchers after the trial has been finalised if it offers more benefits than harms, while no‐treatment participants are not offered the experimental intervention by the researchers.

Search methods
In March 2018, we searched MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Embase, CENTRAL, and seven other databases and six trials registers.

Selection criteria
We included randomised trials assessing patients with a mental health disorder that compared wait‐list, usual care, or placebo interventions with wait‐list or no‐treatment .

Data collection and analysis
Titles, abstracts, and full texts were reviewed for eligibility. Review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using Cochrane’s risk of bias tool. GRADE was used to assess the quality of the evidence. We contacted researchers working in the field to ask for data from additional published and unpublished trials.

A pre‐planned decision hierarchy was used to select one benefit and one harm outcome from each trial. For the assessment of benefits, we summarised continuous data as standardised mean differences (SMDs) and dichotomous data as risk ratios (RRs). We used risk differences (RDs) for the assessment of adverse events. We used random‐effects models for all statistical analyses. We used subgroup analysis to explore potential causes for heterogeneity (e.g. type of placebo) and sensitivity analyses to explore the robustness of the primary analyses (e.g. fixed‐effect model).

Main results
We included 96 randomised trials (4200 participants), ranging from 8 to 393 participants in each trial. 83 trials (3614 participants) provided usable data. The trials included 15 different mental health disorders, the most common being anxiety (25 trials), depression (16 trials), and sleep‐wake disorders (11 trials).

All 96 trials were assessed as high risk of bias partly because of the inability to blind participants and personnel in trials with two control interventions. The quality of evidence was rated low to very low, mostly due to risk of bias, imprecision in estimates, and heterogeneity.

Only one trial compared wait‐list versus no‐treatment directly but the authors were not able to provide us with any usable data on the comparison.

Five trials compared usual care versus wait‐list or no‐treatment and found a SMD –0.33 (95% CI ‐0.83 to 0.16, I² = 86%, 523 participants) on benefits.

The difference between all placebo interventions combined versus wait‐list or no‐treatment was SMD −0.37 (95% CI −0.49 to −0.25, I² = 41%, 65 trials, 2446 participants) on benefits. There was evidence of some asymmetry in the funnel plot (Egger’s test P value of 0.087). Almost all the trials were small. Subgroup analysis found a moderate effect in favour of psychological placebos SMD ‐0.49 (95% CI −0.64 to −0.30; I² = 53%, 39 trials, 1656 participants). The effect of pharmacological placebos versus wait‐list or no‐treatment on benefits was SMD ‐0.14 (95% CI −0.39 to 0.11, 9 trials, 279 participants) and the effect of physical placebos was SMD −0.21 (95% CI −0.35 to −0.08, I² = 0%, 17 trials, 896 participants). We found large variations in effect sizes in the psychological and pharmacological placebo comparisons. For specific mental health disorders, we found significant differences in favour of all placebos for sleep‐wake disorders, major depressive disorder, and anxiety disorders, but the analyses were imprecise due to sparse data.

We found no significant differences in harms for any of the comparisons but the analyses suffered from sparse data.

When using a fixed‐effect model in a sensitivity analysis on the comparison for usual care versus wait‐list and no‐treatment, the results were significant with an SMD of –0.46 (95 % CI –0.64 to –0.28). We reported an alternative risk of bias model where we excluded the blinding domains seeing how issues with blinding may be seen as part of the review investigation itself. However, this did not markedly change the overall risk of bias profile as most of the trials still included one or more unclear bias domains.

Authors' conclusions
We found marked variations in effects between placebo versus no‐treatment and wait‐list and between subtypes of placebo with the same comparisons. Almost all the trials were small with considerable methodological and clinical variability in factors such as mental health population, contents of the included control interventions, and outcome domains. All trials were assessed as high risk of bias and the evidence quality was low to very low.

When researchers decide to use placebos or usual care control interventions in trials with people with mental health disorders it will often lead to lower estimated effects of the experimental intervention than when using wait‐list or no‐treatment controls. The choice of a control intervention therefore has considerable impact on how effective a mental health treatment appears to be. Methodological guideline development is needed to reach a consensus on future standards for the design and reporting of control interventions in mental health intervention research.","Control interventions in randomised trials for people with a mental health disorder
This systematic review assesses the effects of different control interventions in randomised trials including patients with a mental health disorder. In randomised trials, patients are assigned by chance to one of two or more groups – usually an experimental intervention and a control intervention. There are many types of control interventions in mental health intervention research. Some of the most common are different types of placebos that lack what is assumed to be the active component in the experimental intervention, and usual care, where patients receive the standard treatment for their mental health disorder in the area where they live. Two other types of control interventions are wait‐list or no‐treatment where patients receive no trial‐related care during the study (although some patients may receive care outside the studies). Wait‐list patients are often offered the experimental intervention after the trial has been finalised if it is likely to provide more benefits than harms, while no‐treatment participants are not offered the experimental intervention by the researchers.

We searched for randomised trials with patients with mental health disorders where wait‐list, usual care, or placebo interventions were compared with either wait‐list or no‐treatment. We looked at differences between all the types of control interventions on beneficial effects and whether they caused any adverse effects. We included 96 trials with a total of 4200 participants. Only 83 trials (3614 participants) provided usable data. Fifteen different mental health disorders were included. We found that all the trials were at high risk of bias in how they had been conducted, which reduced the interpretability of our findings. However, the risk of bias was mostly due to lack of blinding in the placebo studies, which may be seen as an aspect of the review's methodological question rather than a flaw with the review itself. We found no clinically important differences for usual care or wait‐list control interventions in the main analyses, however in our secondary analyses we found a clinically important favourable difference for usual care. In general, placebo control interventions tended to be favourable over no‐treatment or wait‐list control interventions across mental health disorders. We found no clinically important differences on adverse events.

This review suggests that different control interventions have a tendency to yield very different estimates for the effects of the experimental intervention and that the choice of control intervention has a large impact on how effective a mental health treatment appears to be. Control interventions in trials with patients with mental health disorders are often poorly reported upon, and guidelines are needed to inform researchers on how to properly design, report, and interpret these trials.","Title: Control interventions in randomised trials among people with mental health disorders

Abstract: Background 
 
Most clinical trials of treatments for mental health disorders include a control intervention. The aim of this study was to examine the extent to which the control interventions in these trials are comparable. 
 
 
 
Methods 
 
All randomised controlled trials of treatments for mental health disorders were identified from the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Depression Group Trials Register and the Cochrane Anxiety Group Trials Register. Data were extracted from the control interventions of each trial and were coded using a standard form. 
 
 
 
Results 
 
The study included 116 trials of treatments for schizophrenia, 139 trials of treatments for depression and 120 trials of treatments for anxiety. In 51% of the trials of treatments for schizophrenia, the control intervention was a placebo. The control interventions in 73% of the trials of treatments for depression were no treatment or an inactive placebo. The control interventions in 83% of the trials of treatments for anxiety were no treatment or an inactive placebo. 
 
 
 
Conclusions 
 
The use of placebo controls in trials of treatments for schizophrenia is widespread, but is uncommon in trials of treatments for depression and anxiety. In the future, it would be useful to have a clear definition of what constitutes a placebo.</s>","# Control interventions in randomised trials among people with mental health disorders

A total of 21 randomised trials (19 unique interventions) were included in the review (Table 2). The majority of studies were conducted in high-income countries (15 studies, 71%), while five studies (24%) were conducted in middle-income countries (three in India and two in Brazil). In total, 15 studies (71%) were published in the last decade. In 15 studies (71%), the interventions were delivered by mental health professionals, while in the remaining six studies (29%), the interventions were delivered by lay health workers. The majority of the studies (18 studies, 86%) were delivered at the individual level, while three studies (14%) were delivered at the group level.

Table 2: Characteristics of included randomised trials of control interventions among people with mental health disorders

# Control interventions

The most common control intervention was a waitlist control (11 studies, 52%). Other common control interventions included usual care (seven studies, 33%) and no treatment (three studies, 14%). The number of sessions of the control interventions ranged from one to 10 sessions.

# Mental health outcomes

In total, 15 studies (71%) reported outcomes related to depression, anxiety, stress, or mental well-being, and six studies (29%) reported outcomes related to depression, anxiety, or PTSD. The most common mental health outcome reported was depression (19 studies, 90%), followed by anxiety (14 studies, 67%), stress (13 studies, 62%), and mental well-being (12 studies, 57%). The remaining outcomes reported included suicidal ideation, PTSD, and alcohol use. The most common mental health outcome reported was the depression scale (18 studies, 86%), followed by the anxiety scale (13 studies, 62%), stress scale (12 studies, 57%), and mental well-being scale (10 studies, 48%).

# Quality assessment

All 21 studies (100%) were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). In terms of quality, the overall risk of bias of the included studies was low (Figure 2). Of the 21 studies, six studies (29%) had high risk of bias for the blinding of participants and personnel, and five studies (24%) had high risk of bias for the blinding of outcome assessment. The most common reason for high risk of bias was lack of blinding. In terms of attrition bias, three studies (14%) had high risk of bias. The most common reason for high risk of bias was incomplete outcome data.

Table 9: Effects of control interventions on alcohol use among people with mental health disorders

# Discussion

This systematic review found that control interventions, including waitlist controls, usual care, and no treatment, were effective in reducing depression, anxiety, stress, and mental well-being in people with mental health disorders. We found no evidence for the effectiveness of control interventions in reducing suicidal ideation, PTSD, and alcohol use. In addition, the overall risk of bias of the included studies was low.

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to examine the effects of control interventions in randomised trials among people with mental health disorders. The findings of our review are consistent with previous systematic reviews that examined the effects of control interventions in randomised trials among the general population. Previous systematic reviews found that control interventions, including waitlist controls, usual care, and no treatment, were effective in reducing depression, anxiety, and stress in the general population [[START_REF] Waiting list may be a nocebo condition in psychotherapy trials: a contribution from network meta-analysis, Furukawa[END_REF]-[START_REF] A systematic review of wait-list control groups in antidepressant trials, Furukawa[END_REF]].

The effects of control interventions on mental health may be explained by several factors. First, control interventions, including waitlist controls, usual care, and no treatment, are not placebo interventions. In other words, control interventions are not intended to change the symptoms of mental health disorders but are designed to control for the effects of non-specific factors, such as attention, time, and expectations [[START_REF] Waiting list may be a nocebo condition in psychotherapy trials: a contribution from network meta-analysis, Furukawa[END_REF]]. Second, control interventions are not intended to change the mental health status of people with mental health disorders. Therefore, the control interventions may not be effective in improving mental health outcomes among people with mental health disorders. Third, control interventions are designed to control for the effects of non-specific factors, such as attention, time, and expectations. However, it is possible that non-specific factors may have different effects on people with mental health disorders and the general population. For example, people with mental health disorders may be more susceptible to non-specific factors, such as time and expectations, than people without mental health disorders [[START_REF] The role of expectation in non-specific effects of psychotherapy: The importance of the therapeutic relationship, Bennouna-Greene[END_REF]]. In addition, people with mental health disorders may not receive the same benefits from non-specific factors, such as time and expectations, as people without mental health disorders. For example, people with mental health disorders may not be able to attend all the sessions of the intervention as people without mental health disorders.

Germinal matrix‐intraventricular haemorrhage (GMH‐IVH) and encephalopathy of prematurity (EoP) remain substantial issues in neonatal intensive care units worldwide. Current therapies to prevent or treat these conditions are limited. Stem cell‐based therapies offer a potential therapeutic approach to repair, restore, or regenerate injured brain tissue. These preclinical findings have now culminated in ongoing human neonatal studies. This is an update of the 2019 review, which did not include EoP.

Objectives
To evaluate the benefits and harms of stem cell‐based interventions for prevention or treatment of GM‐IVH and EoP in preterm infants.

Search methods
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was April 2022.

Selection criteria
We attempted to include randomised controlled trials, quasi‐randomised controlled trials, and cluster trials comparing 1. stem cell‐based interventions versus control; 2. mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) of type or source versus MSCs of other type or source; 3. stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs of type or source versus stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs of other type or source; or 4. MSCs versus stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs. For prevention studies, we included extremely preterm infants (less than 28 weeks' gestation), 24 hours of age or less, without ultrasound diagnosis of GM‐IVH or EoP; for treatment studies, we included preterm infants (less than 37 weeks' gestation), of any postnatal age, with ultrasound diagnosis of GM‐IVH or with EoP.

Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. all‐cause neonatal mortality, 2. major neurodevelopmental disability, 3. GM‐IVH, 4. EoP, and 5. extension of pre‐existing non‐severe GM‐IVH or EoP. We planned to use GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main results
We identified no studies that met our inclusion criteria. Three studies are currently registered and ongoing. Phase 1 trials are described in the 'Excluded studies' section.

Authors' conclusions
No evidence is currently available to evaluate the benefits and harms of stem cell‐based interventions for treatment or prevention of GM‐IVH or EoP in preterm infants. We identified three ongoing studies, with a sample size range from 20 to 200. In two studies, autologous cord blood mononuclear cells will be administered to extremely preterm infants via the intravenous route; in one, intracerebroventricular injection of MSCs will be administered to preterm infants up to 34 weeks' gestational age.","Stem cell‐based therapies for brain injury in newborns born preterm
Review question

Do stem cell‐based therapies save the lives or improve the long‐term development of preterm newborns who have or may develop bleeding to the brain (intraventricular haemorrhage) or grey matter damage?

Background

Newborns born too early ('preterm'), especially babies born before 28 weeks of pregnancy, sometimes develop bleeding to the brain. Babies with less severe bleeding may make a full recovery or may have only mild problems. For other babies with more serious bleeding, or with grey matter damage, this may lead to death or to problems later in life. The brain is growing very fast during the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Nerve cells move throughout the brain to destination regions, where they become mature and make connections with each other in order to proceed with the information. In addition, some nerve fibres are surrounded by a specific insulating layer, called myelin, and the process of such insulation – myelinisation – starts around 24 weeks of pregnancy. If the baby is born preterm these processes in the brain may be altered and there is a higher risk for long‐term abnormal neurodevelopment. This condition is called 'encephalopathy of prematurity'. For instance, some of these babies develop intellectual disabilities, behavioural problems, concentration difficulties, socialisation problems, and cerebral palsy. Currently, no approaches are available to prevent or treat bleeding to the brain or grey matter damage.

What did we want to find out?

The aim of this review was to assess whether stem cell‐based therapies could reduce death and improve the long‐term development of newborns born too early. During cell stem‐based therapy, stem cells are given to the baby, for instance, through injection. These stem cells may have come from humans or animals and may have been taken from cord blood, bone marrow, or other parts of the body. These cells then repair the brain cells that have been damaged by bleeding or grey matter damage.

What did we do?

We searched medical databases for clinical trials looking at stem cell‐based therapies for brain injury in newborns born too soon.

Key results

We were unable to include any studies in our review. We did identify nine studies, but we excluded them because of the way they were designed, which meant that their results could not answer our review question.

How current is the evidence?

This review updates and expands our previous review which was published in 2019. The evidence is current to April 2022.
","Title: Stem cell‐based interventions for the prevention and treatment of intraventricular haemorrhage and encephalopathy of prematurity in preterm infants

Abstract: Intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) is a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Over the past 2 decades, significant advances have been made in the understanding of the pathophysiology of IVH. These advances have led to the development of therapeutic interventions to reduce the incidence and severity of IVH. Stem cell‐based interventions are among the most promising of these therapeutic interventions.</s>","# Stem cell‐based interventions for the prevention and treatment of intraventricular haemorrhage and encephalopathy of prematurity in preterm infants

Intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and encephalopathy of prematurity (EoP) are the two most common and most devastating complications in preterm infants. The development of these complications is a complex process and is determined by multiple factors, including the vascular and inflammatory responses of the developing brain, the presence of pre‐existing cerebrovascular abnormalities and antenatal and postnatal risk factors. The vascular response to preterm birth is a dynamic process that involves changes in the expression of angiogenic growth factors and their receptors, and alterations in endothelial function. Inflammation and the complement system are important players in the development of IVH and EoP. Pre‐existing cerebrovascular abnormalities, such as abnormal cortical vascularity and arterial tortuosity, may contribute to the development of IVH. Antenatal and postnatal risk factors, such as intrauterine growth restriction, pre‐eclampsia, respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis, are associated with an increased risk of IVH and EoP. The most important risk factors for the development of IVH and EoP are gestational age and birth weight.

Current clinical management of preterm infants at risk for IVH and EoP includes intensive care and nutritional support, and treatment of respiratory and other complications. There is no consensus on the best treatment to prevent or treat IVH and EoP. Recent studies suggest that stem cell therapy may be a promising treatment to prevent or treat IVH and EoP in preterm infants. Several studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) reduce the development of IVH and EoP in animal models of preterm birth. MSCs reduce IVH and EoP in preterm rabbits by suppressing inflammation, decreasing apoptosis and decreasing oxidative stress. Furthermore, MSCs may reduce the development of IVH and EoP in preterm lambs by promoting angiogenesis. MSCs are a promising candidate for the prevention and treatment of IVH and EoP in preterm infants. However, the underlying mechanisms of action of MSCs need to be further investigated, and larger studies are needed to determine the optimal timing and dose of MSC therapy for preterm infants.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND), causes increasing physical impairment and disability. People with ALS/MND face huge physical challenges, and the diagnosis can be a source of great psychological distress for both people with ALS/MND and their carers. In such a context, how news of the diagnosis is broken is important. At present, there are no systematic reviews of methods for informing people with ALS/MND of their diagnosis.

Objectives
To examine the effects and effectiveness of different methods for informing people of a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND), including effects on the person's knowledge and understanding of their disease, its treatment, and care; and on coping and adjustment to the effects of ALS/MND, its treatment, and care.

Search methods
We searched the Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and two trials registers (February 2022). We contacted individuals or organisations to locate studies. We contacted study authors to obtain additional unpublished data.

Selection criteria
We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs of techniques for informing people with ALS/MND of their diagnosis. We planned to include adults (aged 17 years or over) with ALS/MND, according to the El Escorial criteria.

Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently reviewed the results of the search to identify RCTs, and three review authors identified non‐randomised studies to include in the discussion section. We planned that two review authors would independently extract data, and three would assess the risk of bias in any included trials.

Main results
We did not identify any RCTs that met our inclusion criteria.

Authors' conclusions
There are no RCTs that evaluate different communication strategies for breaking the bad news for people diagnosed with ALS/MND.

Focused research studies are needed to assess the effectiveness and efficacy of different communication methods.
","Methods for informing people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease of their diagnosis
Review question

We planned to assess the evidence about communicating the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or motor neuron disease (MND).

Background

ALS, which is also known as MND, is an illness affecting the nerves that control movement. It causes increasing disability, including limb weakness, difficulty with breathing, and speech and swallowing problems. Most importantly, people with ALS/MND have to cope with the fact that ALS/MND usually leads to death within three to five years of onset. At diagnosis, people with ALS/MND, relatives, and carers can experience enormous distress, therefore, it is important to understand how to tell them the diagnosis. We carried out a wide search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of methods of communicating the diagnosis of ALS/MND.

Results

We found no RCTs of methods for giving a diagnosis of ALS/MND.

We searched to February 2022.

CD008106.pub4,Surgical versus non‐surgical interventions for treating patellar dislocation,2023,January,24,4,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008106.pub4,"Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma",Orthopaedics & trauma,"Background
Patellar (knee cap) dislocation occurs when the patella disengages completely from the trochlear (femoral) groove. It affects up to 42/100,000 people, and is most prevalent in those aged 20 to 30 years old. It is uncertain whether surgical or non‐surgical treatment is the best approach. This is important as recurrent dislocation occurs in up to 40% of people who experience a first time (primary) dislocation. This can reduce quality of life and as a result people have to modify their lifestyle. This review is needed to determine whether surgical or non‐surgical treatment should be offered to people after patellar dislocation.

Objectives
To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of surgical versus non‐surgical interventions for treating people with primary or recurrent patellar dislocation.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL, Physiotherapy Evidence Database and trial registries in December 2021. We contacted corresponding authors to identify additional studies.

Selection criteria
We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled clinical trials evaluating surgical versus non‐surgical interventions for treating primary or recurrent lateral patellar dislocation in adults or children.

Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were recurrent patellar dislocation, and patient‐rated knee and physical function scores. Our secondary outcomes were health‐related quality of life, return to former activities, knee pain during activity or at rest, adverse events, patient‐reported satisfaction, patient‐reported knee instability symptoms and subsequent requirement for knee surgery. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main results
We included 10 studies (eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and two quasi‐RCTs) of 519 participants with patellar dislocation. The mean ages in the individual studies ranged from 13.0 to 27.2 years. Four studies included children, mainly adolescents, as well as adults; two only recruited children. Study follow‐up ranged from one to 14 years.

We are unsure of the evidence for all outcomes in this review because we judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low. We downgraded each outcome by three levels. Reasons included imprecision (when fewer than 100 events were reported or the confidence interval (CI) indicated appreciable benefits as well as harms), risk of bias (when studies were at high risk of performance, detection and attrition bias), and inconsistency (in the event that pooled analysis included high levels of statistical heterogeneity).

We are uncertain whether surgery lowers the risk of recurrent dislocation following primary patellar dislocation compared with non‐surgical management at two to nine year follow‐up. Based on an illustrative risk of recurrent dislocation in 348 people per 1000 in the non‐surgical group, we found that 157 fewer people per 1000 (95% CI 209 fewer to 87 fewer) had recurrent dislocation between two and nine years after surgery (8 studies, 438 participants).

We are uncertain whether surgery improves patient‐rated knee and function scores. Studies measured this outcome using different scales (the Tegner activity scale, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Lysholm, Kujala Patellofemoral Disorders score and Hughston visual analogue scale). The most frequently reported score was the Kujala Patellofemoral Disorders score. This indicated people in the surgical group had a mean score of 5.73 points higher at two to nine year follow‐up (95% CI 2.91 lower to 14.37 higher; 7 studies, 401 participants). On this 100‐point scale, higher scores indicate better function, and a change score of 10 points is considered to be clinically meaningful; therefore, this CI includes a possible meaningful improvement.

We are uncertain whether surgery increases the risk of adverse events. Based on an assumed risk of overall incidence of complications during the first two years in 277 people out of 1000 in the non‐surgical group, 335 more people per 1000 (95% CI 75 fewer to 723 more) had an adverse event in the surgery group (2 studies, 144 participants).

Three studies (176 participants) assessed participant satisfaction at two to nine year follow‐up, reporting little difference between groups. Based on an assumed risk of 763 per 1000 non‐surgical participants reporting excellent or good outcomes, seven more participants per 1000 (95% CI 199 fewer to 237 more) reported excellent or good satisfaction.

Four studies (256 participants) assessed recurrent patellar subluxation at two to nine year follow‐up. Based on an assumed risk of patellar subluxation in 292 out of 1000 in the non‐surgical group, 73 fewer people per 1000 (95% CI 146 fewer to 35 more) had patellar subluxation as a result of surgery.

Slightly more people had subsequent surgery in the non‐surgical group. Pooled two to nine year follow‐up data from three trials (195 participants) indicated that, based on an assumed risk of subsequent surgery in 215 people per 1000 in the non‐surgical group, 118 fewer people per 1000 (95% CI 200 fewer to 372 more) had subsequent surgery after primary surgery.

Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain whether surgery improves outcome compared to non‐surgical management as the certainty of the evidence was very low. No sufficiently powered trial has examined people with recurrent patellar dislocation. Adequately powered, multicentre, randomised trials are needed. To inform the design and conduct of these trials, expert consensus should be achieved on the minimal description of both surgical and non‐surgical interventions, and the pathological variations that may be relevant to both choice of these interventions.","Surgery or non‐surgical treatments: which works better to treat people who have a dislocated knee cap?
Key messages

We did not find enough good‐quality evidence to show whether surgery or non‐surgical treatment works better to treat people who have a dislocated knee cap.

Good‐quality research is required that compare these treatments.

What is a dislocated knee cap?

The knee cap is a lens‐shaped bone at the front of the knee. A dislocation occurs when the knee cap completely moves out of the groove in the thigh‐bone at the knee. It typically occurs in young, physically active people when they twist their bent knee whilst their foot is fixed to the ground. The cause of a dislocation may be linked to an abnormal shape of the knee bones, weakness of the muscles around the hip or knees, or tightness of soft tissues on the outside of the knee.

After a knee cap dislocation, some people recover completely. But some people may have repeated dislocations, or a feeling of instability in their knee cap, or both. They may also have persistent pain or limited function.

How is a dislocated knee cap treated?

When the knee cap dislocates, the soft tissues around the knee are injured. People need to have treatment to help restore the knee back to full health. This may include treatments such as holding the knee in place (by wearing a kind of brace or bandage), exercises, manual therapy (such as physiotherapy) and taping the area around the knee. However, some doctors suggest that people may have a better outcome if surgery is performed. Surgery may be used to: repair or reconstruct the injured ligaments and muscles that hold the knee cap in the groove, reshape the groove, or change where the knee cap attaches to the shin‐bone to stop it from dislocating again.

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to find out whether surgery or non‐surgical treatment was better at preventing another knee cap dislocation and restoring knee function. We also looked at any unwanted effects of treatment, how satisfied people were with their treatment, symptoms of instability and the need for surgery after the initial treatment.

What did we do?

We searched the medical literature until December 2021 for studies that compared surgical with non‐surgical treatment for adults or children who had a patellar dislocation. We summarised and compared the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.

What did we find?

We found 10 relevant studies (519 adults and children). Studies randomly allocated people to receive surgery or a non‐surgical treatment. In nine studies, people were treated for a first‐time dislocation, one study treated people after repeated knee cap dislocations. People ranged from 13 to 27 years of age, with six studies including children. People in the studies were monitored from one to nine years after their injury.

Main results

We were very uncertain about whether surgery compared to non‐surgical treatment:

‐ reduced the number of repeat dislocations;

‐ affected how well the knee cap worked;

‐ increased or reduced the risk of side effects;

‐ made a difference to how satisfied people were with treatment;

‐ increased or reduced instability in the knee cap; or

‐ increased or reduced the need for additional surgery.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

These studies were small. Some had weaknesses in their design and conduct. The quality of the evidence is very low. We were very uncertain about these findings.

How up to date is this evidence?

This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.","Title: Surgical versus non‐surgical interventions for treating patellar dislocation

Abstract: Patellar dislocation is a common injury of the knee joint, with a prevalence of 0.3% in the general population and 2–5% in young athletes. The natural history of this injury is often poor, and most people who have a patellar dislocation develop recurrent dislocations. The majority of people with patellar dislocation have a significant patellofemoral joint (PFJ) arthritis, which results in significant pain and disability. Surgical treatment has been shown to improve outcomes for people with recurrent patellar dislocation. However, there is little high quality evidence comparing surgical versus non‐surgical treatment for first‐time patellar dislocation.</s>","# Surgical versus non‐surgical interventions for treating patellar dislocation

The results of the meta‐analysis showed that the rate of redislocation in the surgical group was lower than that in the non‐surgical group, with a significant difference (RR = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.09–0.58, p = 0.002) (Figure 5).

# Discussion

The patella is a sesamoid bone that lies between the femur and tibia in the knee joint, and it is located in the superior lateral patellar tendon. Patellar dislocation is a common and serious injury of the knee joint, and it is often accompanied by severe pain, limited range of motion, and even dysfunction.[START_REF] A comparison of the clinical outcomes of medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction and medial patellotibial ligament reconstruction for recurrent patellar dislocation, Li[END_REF] The etiology of patellar dislocation includes soft tissue injury, patella malalignment, and patella dysplasia.[START_REF] Epidemiology of acute patellar dislocation in children and adolescents: a 20-year population-based study, Huttunen[END_REF]

The patella is a sesamoid bone that lies between the femur and tibia in the knee joint, and it is located in the superior lateral patellar tendon. The patellar ligament consists of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL), the lateral patellofemoral ligament (LPFL), and the patellar retinaculum (PR).[START_REF] A comparison of the clinical outcomes of medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction and medial patellotibial ligament reconstruction for recurrent patellar dislocation, Li[END_REF] The MPFL is the main ligament that connects the patella to the femur, and it can prevent the patella from lateral dislocation.[START_REF] A comparison of the clinical outcomes of medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction and medial patellotibial ligament reconstruction for recurrent patellar dislocation, Li[END_REF]

In the current study, 24 RCTs involving 2334 patients with patellar dislocation were included, and the meta‐analysis results showed that the rate of redislocation in the surgical group was lower than that in the non‐surgical group, with a significant difference. This finding is consistent with those of previous studies.[START_REF] Comparison of medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction with or without additional tibial tubercle transfer in recurrent patellar dislocation: a systematic review and meta-analysis, Zhang[END_REF], [START_REF] Surgical versus conservative interventions for treating patellar dislocation, Zhang[END_REF], [START_REF] Medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction versus medial patellotibial ligament reconstruction for recurrent patellar dislocation: a systematic review and meta-analysis, Zhang[END_REF], [START_REF] Surgical versus non-surgical interventions for treating patellar dislocation, Zhang[END_REF] However, the results of the meta‐analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the rate of redislocation between the two groups, which is inconsistent with the results of previous studies.[START_REF] Medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction versus medial patellotibial ligament reconstruction for recurrent patellar dislocation: a systematic review and meta-analysis, Zhang[END_REF], [START_REF] Surgical versus non-surgical interventions for treating patellar dislocation, Zhang[END_REF] This difference may be due to the fact that the surgical methods used in the previous studies were not uniform, and the surgical methods included in the current study were all patellar dislocation repair surgery. The results of the current study showed that there was no significant difference in the rate of redislocation between the two groups. The reason may be that most of the studies included in the current study did not have a long‐term follow‐up period, and the follow‐up period of some studies was less than 1 year.

The current study has several limitations. First, the surgical methods included in the current study were all patellar dislocation repair surgery, and the types of surgical methods were not uniform. Second, the follow‐up time of the included studies was not long enough, and the follow‐up time of some studies was less than 1 year. Third, some studies did not report the specific time of patellar dislocation. Therefore, more RCTs with a longer follow‐up time are needed to verify the results of the current study.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the results of the current study suggest that surgical intervention is superior to non‐surgical intervention in terms of redislocation rate, and it is an effective treatment for patellar dislocation. However, due to the limitations of the current study, further research is needed to verify the results of the current study.

Clonidine is a presynaptic alpha‐2‐adrenergic receptor agonist that has been used for many years to treat hypertension and other conditions, including chronic pain. Adverse events associated with systemic use of the drug have limited its application. Topical use of drugs has been gaining interest since the beginning of the century, as it may limit adverse events without loss of analgesic efficacy. Topical clonidine (TC) formulations have been investigated for almost 20 years in clinical trials. This is an update of the original Cochrane Review published in Issue 8, 2015.

Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the analgesic efficacy and safety of TC compared with placebo or other drugs in adults aged 18 years or above with chronic neuropathic pain.

Search methods
For this update we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO), MEDLINE (Ovid), and Embase (Ovid) databases, and reference lists of retrieved papers and trial registries. We also contacted experts in the field. The most recent search was performed on 27 October 2021.

Selection criteria
We included randomised, double‐blind studies of at least two weeks' duration comparing TC versus placebo or other active treatment in adults with chronic neuropathic pain.

Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened references for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion or by consulting a third review author if necessary. Where required, we contacted trial authors to request additional information.

We presented pooled estimates for dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs) with P values. We used Review Manager Web software to perform the meta‐analyses. We used a fixed‐effect model if we considered heterogeneity as not important; otherwise, we used a random‐effects model. 

The review primary outcomes were: participant‐reported pain relief of 50% or greater; participant‐reported pain relief of 30% or greater; much or very much improved on Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC); and very much improved on PGIC. Secondary outcomes included withdrawals due to adverse events; participants experiencing at least one adverse event; and withdrawals due to lack of efficacy. All outcomes were measured at the longest follow‐up period.

We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE and created two summary of findings tables.

Main results
We included four studies in the review (two new in this update), with a total of 743 participants with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN). TC (0.1% or 0.2%) was applied in gel form to the painful area two to three times daily. The double‐blind treatment phase of three studies lasted 8 weeks to 85 days and compared TC versus placebo. In the fourth study, the double‐blind treatment phase lasted 12 weeks and compared TC versus topical capsaicin. We assessed the studies as at unclear or high risk of bias for most domains; all studies were at unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessment; one study was at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel; two studies were at high risk of attrition bias; and three studies were at high risk of bias due to notable funding concerns. We judged the certainty of evidence (GRADE) to be moderate to very low, downgrading for study limitations, imprecision of results, and publication bias.

TC compared to placebo

There was no evidence of a difference in number of participants with participant‐reported pain relief of 50% or greater during longest follow‐up period (12 weeks) between groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.86; 179 participants; 1 study; low certainty evidence). However, the number of participants with participant‐reported pain relief of 30% or greater during longest follow‐up period (8 to 12 weeks) was higher in the TC group compared with placebo (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.77; 344 participants; 2 studies, very low certainty evidence). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) for this comparison was 8.33 (95% CI 4.3 to 50.0). Also, there was no evidence of a difference between groups for the outcomes much or very much improved on the PGIC during longest follow‐up period (12 weeks) or very much improved on PGIC during the longest follow‐up period (12 weeks) (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.49 and RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.72, respectively; 179 participants; 1 study; low certainty evidence). We observed no evidence of a difference between groups in withdrawals due to adverse events and withdrawals due to lack of efficacy during the longest follow‐up period (12 weeks) (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.18 and RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.92, respectively; 179 participants; 1 study; low certainty evidence) and participants experiencing at least one adverse event during longest follow‐up period (12 weeks) (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.14 to 3.05; 344 participants; 2 studies; low certainty evidence). 

TC compared to active comparator

There was no evidence of a difference in the number of participants with participant‐reported pain relief of 50% or greater during longest follow‐up period (12 weeks) between groups (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.0; 139 participants; 1 study; low certainty evidence). Other outcomes were not reported.

Authors' conclusions
This is an update of a review published in 2015, for which our conclusions remain unchanged. Topical clonidine may provide some benefit to adults with painful diabetic neuropathy; however, the evidence is very uncertain. Additional trials are needed to assess TC in other neuropathic pain conditions and to determine whether it is possible to predict who or which groups of people will benefit from TC.","Clonidine applied to the skin for adults with chronic neuropathic pain
Key message

We found no high certainty evidence to support the use of clonidine applied to the skin for painful diabetic neuropathy. We found no evidence for other chronic pain conditions.

What did we do?

To find out how clonidine applied to the skin (topical clonidine) works in people with neuropathic pain, we searched medical databases and references of retrieved papers and registries or clinical trials. We also contacted experts in the field. Two review authors independently screened references for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. When necessary, we contacted trial authors to request additional information.

What did we find?

We identified four studies for inclusion in the review. The studies lasted 8 weeks to 85 days and included a total of 743 participants with painful diabetic neuropathy. Clonidine (0.1% or 0.2%) was applied in gel form to the painful area two to three times daily, and was compared with placebo (dummy treatment) in three studies and with capsaicin applied to the skin in one study.

Limitations in how the studies were conducted and reported and the small amount of evidence available means that our confidence in the results is limited. The evidence suggests that in adults with painful diabetic neuropathy, topical clonidine may provide pain relief in some people. However, topical clonidine was not better than placebo for our other outcomes. We found no evidence of a difference between topical clonidine and capsaicin applied to the skin in painful diabetic neuropathy. The information from clinical trials is not enough to judge about possible long‐term side effects of clonidine applied to the skin; however, we found that during 8 to 12 weeks of treatment there was no evidence of a difference in number of side effects between study groups. We also do not know from the included trials how clonidine works in other chronic neuropathic pain conditions.

How up‐to‐date is this evidence?

The review is current to 27 October 2021.","Title: Topical clonidine for neuropathic pain in adults

CD011507.pub3,Antenatal dietary supplementation with myo‐inositol for preventing gestational diabetes,2023,February,15,3,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011507.pub3,Pregnancy and Childbirth,Pregnancy & childbirth,"Background
Gestational diabetes with onset or first recognition during pregnancy is an increasing problem worldwide. Myo‐inositol, an isomer of inositol, is a naturally occurring sugar commonly found in cereals, corn, legumes and meat. Myo‐inositol is one of the intracellular mediators of the insulin signal and correlates with insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes. The potential beneficial effect of improving insulin sensitivity suggests that myo‐inositol may be useful for women in preventing gestational diabetes. This is an update of a review first published in 2015.

Objectives
To assess if antenatal dietary supplementation with myo‐inositol is safe and effective, for the mother and fetus, in preventing gestational diabetes.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP (17 March 2022) and the reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection criteria
We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including cluster‐RCTs and conference abstracts, assessing the effects of myo‐inositol for the prevention of gestational diabetes in pregnant women. We included studies that compared any dose of myo‐inositol, alone or in a combination preparation, with no treatment, placebo or another intervention. Quasi‐randomised and cross‐over trials were not eligible. We excluded women with pre‐existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted the data. We checked the data for accuracy. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main results
We included seven RCTs (one conducted in Ireland, six conducted in Italy) reporting on 1319 women who were 10 weeks to 24 weeks pregnant at the start of the studies. The studies had relatively small sample sizes and the overall risk of bias was low.

For the primary maternal outcomes, meta‐analysis showed that myo‐inositol may reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes (risk ratio (RR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 0.90; 6 studies, 1140 women) and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.61; 5 studies, 1052 women). However, the certainty of the evidence was low to very low. For the primary neonatal outcomes, only one study measured the risk of a large‐for‐gestational‐age infant and found myo‐inositol was associated with both appreciable benefit and harm (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.65 to 3.02; 1 study, 234 infants; low‐certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported on the other primary neonatal outcomes (perinatal mortality, mortality or morbidity composite).

For the secondary maternal outcomes, we are unclear about the effect of myo‐inositol on weight gain during pregnancy (mean difference (MD) ‐0.25 kilogram (kg), 95% CI ‐1.26 to 0.75 kg; 4 studies, 831 women) and perineal trauma (RR 4.0, 95% CI 0.45 to 35.25; 1 study, 234 women) because the evidence was assessed as being very low‐certainty. Further, myo‐inositol may result in little to no difference in caesarean section (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.07; 4 studies, 829 women; low‐certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported on the other secondary maternal outcomes (postnatal depression and the development of subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus). For the secondary neonatal outcomes, meta‐analysis showed no neonatal hypoglycaemia (RR 3.07, 95% CI 0.90 to 10.52; 4 studies; 671 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). However, myo‐inositol may be associated with a reduction in the incidence of preterm birth (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.70; 4 studies; 829 infants). There were insufficient data for a number of maternal and neonatal secondary outcomes, and no data were reported for any of the long‐term childhood or adulthood outcomes, or for health service utilisation outcomes.

Authors' conclusions
Evidence from seven studies shows that antenatal dietary supplementation with myo‐inositol during pregnancy may reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and preterm birth. Limited data suggest that supplementation with myo‐inositol may not reduce the risk of a large‐for‐gestational‐age infant. 

The current evidence is based on small studies that were not powered to detect differences in outcomes such as perinatal mortality and serious infant morbidity. Six of the included studies were conducted in Italy and one in Ireland, which raises concerns about the lack of generalisability to other settings. There is evidence of inconsistency among doses of myo‐inositol, the timing of administration and study population. As a result, we downgraded the certainty of the evidence for many outcomes to low or very low certainty.

Further studies for this promising antenatal intervention for preventing gestational diabetes are encouraged and should include pregnant women of different ethnicities and varying risk factors. Myo‐inositol at different doses, frequency and timing of administration, should be compared with placebo, diet and exercise, and pharmacological interventions. Long‐term follow‐up should be considered and outcomes should include potential harms, including adverse effects.  ","Taking myo‐inositol as a dietary supplement during pregnancy to prevent the development of gestational diabetes
Key messages

Women who develop gestational diabetes have a higher risk of experiencing complications during pregnancy and birth, as well as developing diabetes later on in life. The babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes can be larger than they should be and might be injured at birth. These babies are at risk of diabetes, even as young children or young adults. The number of women being diagnosed with gestational diabetes is increasing around the world, so finding simple and cost‐effective ways to prevent women from developing this condition is important.

Myo‐inositol is a naturally‐occurring sugar found in cereals, corn, green vegetables, and meat, that has a role in the body's sensitivity to insulin.

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to find out if myo‐inositol is an effective antenatal dietary supplement for preventing gestational diabetes in pregnant women.

What did we do?

We searched for studies that compared myo‐inositol (given alone or in combination with another treatment) with no treatment or another treatment. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.

What did we find?

We found seven studies on 1319 women who were 10 weeks to 24 weeks pregnant.

Main results

We are unclear whether supplementation with myo‐inositol is associated with a reduction in the rate of gestational diabetes. However, myo‐inositol may be associated with a reduction of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. We are unclear whether myo‐inositol supplementation decreases the number of babies who were born large for gestational age.  

The studies did not provide any information about the number of babies that died (either before birth or shortly afterwards), depression, or subsequent type 2 diabetes after delivery. There were no maternal adverse effects of therapy in the five studies that reported on this outcome; the other two studies did not mention this.

We are unclear about the effect of supplementation with myo‐inositol on weight gain during pregnancy or on a baby with low blood glucose levels. This review did not find any impact on other outcomes, such as the risk of having a caesarean section or a large baby. This may be due to the studies being too small to detect differences in these outcomes and the outcomes not being reported by all studies. However, myo‐inositol may be associated with a reduction in the rate of preterm birth compared with the control group.

The included studies did not report on many other relevant mother and baby outcomes, nor did they have any data relating to longer‐term outcomes for the mother or infant, or the cost to the health services.

There is not enough evidence to support that giving myo‐inositol as a dietary supplement during pregnancy, prevents gestational diabetes. However, myo‐inositol may prevent hypertensive (high blood pressure) disorders of pregnancy and preterm birth. Further large, well‐designed, randomised controlled trials are required to assess the effectiveness of myo‐inositol in preventing gestational diabetes and improving other health outcomes for mothers and their babies.

What are the limitations of this evidence?

We have little confidence in the evidence because there were not enough studies to be certain about the results and many of our review outcomes were not reported in the studies that we identified. The studies were also limited to populations from high‐income settings and so results may not be applicable to other populations. The studies also had some limitations on how they reported the methods. 

How up to date is this evidence?

This evidence is up‐to‐date to December 2022.","Title: Antenatal dietary supplementation with myo‐inositol for preventing gestational diabetes

Abstract: Background Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects 1–14% of pregnancies and is associated with increased risks of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Myo‐inositol is a naturally occurring sugar alcohol, which is involved in insulin signal transduction and has been found to improve insulin sensitivity in non‐pregnant subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Myo‐inositol is found in a variety of foods, including fruits and vegetables. Aim To investigate whether antenatal dietary supplementation with myo‐inositol reduces the incidence of GDM in women with a history of GDM. Methods A double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary referral centre. Women with a history of GDM were randomised to receive 1500 mg myo‐inositol or placebo daily from 20 weeks of gestation until 12 weeks postpartum. The primary outcome was the incidence of GDM. Secondary outcomes included the prevalence of pregnancy‐induced hypertension and caesarean section. Results 144 women were randomised (72 myo‐inositol, 72 placebo). The prevalence of GDM was 22.2% (16/72) in the myo‐inositol group and 31.9% (23/72) in the placebo group (relative risk 0.73, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.62, p=0.43). The prevalence of pregnancy‐induced hypertension was 3.1% (2/72) in the myo‐inositol group and 7.1% (5/72) in the placebo group (relative risk 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 2.68, p=0.31). The prevalence of caesarean section was 20.8% (15/72) in the myo‐inositol group and 22.2% (16/72) in the placebo group (relative risk 0.94, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.95, p=0.87). Conclusion Myo‐inositol supplementation during pregnancy does not appear to reduce the risk of GDM in women with a history of GDM.</s>","# Antenatal dietary supplementation with myo‐inositol for preventing gestational diabetes

Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Myo‐inositol is an insulin‐sensitising nutrient and may reduce the risk of GDM. We conducted a randomised, placebo‐controlled trial to investigate the effect of antenatal myo‐inositol supplementation on GDM.

Methods: We conducted a multicentre, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial of 1452 pregnant women between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. Women were randomised to receive either myo‐inositol (1 g/day) or a placebo for 24 weeks. The primary outcome was the development of GDM. Secondary outcomes included pregnancy complications, neonatal anthropometry and glycaemic control.

Results: We enrolled 1452 women and 1397 completed the study. The incidence of GDM was 20.4% in the myo‐inositol group and 22.1% in the placebo group (odds ratio [OR] 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66, 1.20; P = 0.44). There were no differences in pregnancy complications, neonatal anthropometry or glycaemic control. Women in the myo‐inositol group had a lower rate of pre‐eclampsia (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.38, 0.99; P = 0.04).

Conclusions: In this large, randomised trial, antenatal myo‐inositol supplementation did not reduce the risk of GDM. There were no adverse effects of myo‐inositol on pregnancy outcomes. However, myo‐inositol supplementation was associated with a lower rate of pre‐eclampsia.

Trial registration: The trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12614001038885).

Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. It is characterized by hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation and polycystic ovaries. The incidence of PCOS ranges from 6% to 10% in the general population. The aim of this study was to investigate the pregnancy outcomes of women with PCOS.

Methods: This study included 136 women with PCOS who were diagnosed with the Rotterdam criteria. The patients were examined in the first trimester and the pregnancy outcomes were evaluated in the third trimester.

Results: The mean age of the patients was 27.6±5.1 years. The mean body mass index was 26.2±5.4 kg/m[START_SUP]2[END_SUP]. The mean gestational age at delivery was 38.8±1.4 weeks. A total of 92 (67.4%) women had term deliveries and 44 (32.6%) women had preterm deliveries. The mean birth weight was 3038.9±453.8 g. There were 46 (33.9%) low birth weight babies and 90 (66.1%) normal birth weight babies. There were 58 (42.4%) macrosomic babies and 78 (57.6%) normal birth weight babies. There were 20 (14.7%) preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) cases. The mean gestational age at PPROM was 32.8±3.5 weeks. The mean birth weight of the PPROM babies was 2762.0±592.2 g. There were 23 (16.8%) congenital malformations and 33 (24.1%) small for gestational age (SGA) babies. The mean birth weight of the babies with congenital malformations was 2964.4±642.4 g. The mean birth weight of the babies with SGA was 2542.5±373.9 g. There were 3 (2.2%) neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions. The mean gestational age at NICU admission was 33.3±1.8 weeks. There were 14 (10.2%) babies with congenital malformations who were admitted to NICU.

Conclusions: PCOS is a common disorder in women of reproductive age. Pregnancy outcomes of women with PCOS are similar to those of the general population.

Background: Obesity is a public health problem. Its incidence has increased in the last decades and is associated with an increased risk of maternal and fetal complications.

Objective: To evaluate maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by obesity.

Methods: A prospective cohort study with pregnant women admitted to 5 different public maternity hospitals in Brazil, between June 2017 and May 2018. The pregnant women were included in the study when they had a body mass index (BMI) of ≥30 kg/m[START_SUP]2[END_SUP]. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were evaluated and compared to those of pregnant women with BMI <30 kg/m[START_SUP]2[END_SUP].

Results: Of the 1500 pregnant women included in the study, 20.6% (n = 308) were classified as obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m[START_SUP]2[END_SUP]). The mean age of the pregnant women was 28.4 ± 5.1 years. There were no differences in the mean age between the obese and non‐obese groups (P = 0.513). The mean gestational age at delivery was 38.8 ± 1.4 weeks. The mean birth weight was "
CD011538.pub2,Education support services for improving school engagement and academic performance of children and adolescents with a chronic health condition,2023,February,8,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011538.pub2,Public Health,Public health,"Background
Chronic health conditions in children and adolescents can have profound impacts on education, well‐being and health. They are described as non‐communicable illnesses that are prolonged in duration, do not resolve spontaneously, and rarely cured completely. Due to variations in the definition of chronic health conditions and how they are measured prevalence estimates vary considerably and have been reported to be as high as 44% in children and adolescents. Of young people with a chronic health condition, an estimated 5% are affected by severe conditions characterised by limitations to daily activities impacting their ability to attend school. School attendance is important for academic and social skill development as well as well‐being. When children and adolescents are absent from school due to a chronic health condition, school engagement can be affected. Disengagement from school is associated with poorer academic achievement, social‐emotional functioning and career choices. Education support services for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions aim to prevent disengagement from school, education and learning during periods where their illness caused them to miss school. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of educational support interventions at improving school engagement and educational/learning outcomes for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions.

Objectives
To describe the nature of educational support interventions for children and adolescents with a chronic health condition, and to examine the effectiveness of these interventions on school engagement and academic achievement.

Search methods
We searched eight electronic databases which span the health/medical, social sciences and education disciplines between 18 and 25 January 2021: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid). CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO (EBSCO), ERIC (Education Resources Information Center), Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts: ASSIA (ProQuest), and PubMed (from 2019). We also searched five grey literature trials registers and databases between 8 and 12 February 2021 to identify additional published and unpublished studies, theses and conference abstracts, as well as snowballing reference lists of included studies.

Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before‐and‐after studies and interrupted time series studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected. Other inclusion criteria were: participants ‐ must include children or adolescents (aged four to 18 years) with a chronic health condition, intervention ‐ must include educational support, outcomes ‐ must report the primary outcomes (i.e. school engagement or academic achievement) or secondary outcomes (i.e. quality of life, transition to school/school re‐entry, mental health or adverse outcomes).

Data collection and analysis
Two people independently screened titles and abstracts, and full‐text articles, to identify included studies. Where disagreements arose between reviewers, the two reviewers discussed the discrepancy. If resolution was unable to be achieved, the issues were discussed with a senior reviewer to resolve the matter. We extracted study characteristic data and risk of bias data from the full texts of included studies using a data extraction form before entering the information into Review Manager 5.4.1. Two people independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias of individual studies and undertook GRADE assessments of the quality of the evidence.

Meta‐analysis was not possible due to the small number of studies for each outcome. Our synthesis, therefore, used vote‐counting based on the direction of the effect/impact of the intervention.

Main results
The database searches identified 14,202 titles and abstracts. Grey literature and reference list searches did not identify any additional studies that met the inclusion criteria. One hundred and twelve full‐text studies were assessed for eligibility, of which four studies met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review. All studies were randomised controlled studies with a combined total of 359 participants. All included studies were disease‐specific; three studies focused on children with cancer, and one study focused on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

There was evidence that education support improved school engagement with three of four studies favouring the intervention. Three studies measured academic achievement but only two studies provided effect estimates. Based on the vote‐counting method, we found contradictory results from the studies: one study showed a positive direction of effect and the other study showed a negative direction of effect. One study measured transition back to school and found a positive impact of education support favouring the intervention (SMD 0.18, 95% CI ‐0.46 to 0.96, no P value reported). The result came from a single study with a small sample size (n = 30), and produced a confidence interval that indicated the possibility of a very small or no effect. The overall certainty of evidence for these three outcomes was judged to be 'very low'.

Two of four studies measured mental health (measured as self‐esteem). Both studies reported a positive impact of education support interventions on mental health; this was the only outcome for which the overall certainty of evidence was judged to be 'low' rather than 'very low'.

No studies measured or reported quality of life or adverse effects.

Risk of bias (selection, performance, detection, attrition, reporting and other bias) was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials (version 1). Overall risk of bias for all studies was assessed as 'high risk' because all studies had at least one domain at high risk of bias.

Authors' conclusions
This review has demonstrated the infancy of quality research on the effectiveness of education support interventions for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. At best, we can say that we are uncertain whether education support interventions improve either academic achievement or school engagement. Of the secondary outcomes, we are also uncertain whether education support interventions improve transition back to school, or school re‐entry. However, we suggest there is some evidence that education support may slightly improve mental health, measured as self‐esteem. Given the current state of the evidence of the effectiveness of education support interventions for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, we highlight some important implications for future research in this field to strengthen the evidence that can inform effective practice and policy.","Do services to support the education of children and teenagers with chronic health conditions help to engage them more in school activities and improve learning outcomes?
Key Messages

‐ We are still unclear of the effect of education support interventions on school engagement, learning outcomes and the likelihood of students to return to school (during periods of wellness).

‐ There is some evidence that education support interventions may improve mental health slightly, as measured in two studies as self‐esteem, but quality of life was not measured in the studies.

‐ We need more good quality evidence, including studies undertaken beyond the USA, to help us know whether these interventions work, and what best practice models would look like.

What are education support services and why might they be helpful for children and teenagers with a chronic health condition?

For some children and teenagers, having a chronic health condition can impact on their school attendance, participation and engagement. This can reduce their ability to keep up with their peers and reach their full potential. Education support services for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions aim to prevent them from becoming disengaged from school and their education and learning when they miss school due to illness. These services can take place in hospital, regular school or community, and may target the child, family, school, hospital, community or a combination of these. They can be delivered or co‐ordinated by the parents/carers, hospital, regular school or by community‐based organisations.

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to describe educational support interventions for children and adolescents with a chronic health condition and find out what effect they had on school engagement and learning outcomes, in particular. We also wanted to see if these services had an effect on mental health and quality of life.

What did we do?

We searched health, education and social science databases, as well as other registries to find published and unpublished studies. We included studies that included children aged four to 18 years with a chronic health condition who were involved in an educational support programme. The study needed to have reported on school engagement, academic achievement, school re‐entry, mental health, quality of life or adverse outcomes to be included in the summarised evidence.

What did we find?

We found four studies that met our inclusion criteria. All studies were randomised controlled studies with a combined total of 359 participants. All four studies were from the United States of America. Three studies included children with cancer, and one study focused on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Two of the cancer studies looked at education support programmes focused on the effect of cancer treatment on the child's memory and how fast they processed information. Mental health was measured as self‐esteem in two studies. School re‐entry was measured in one study; and quality of life was not measured in any included study. No adverse effects were measured or reported in any of the included studies.

Main results

Overall, we are uncertain whether education support interventions improve either school engagement or academic achievement. We are also uncertain whether education support interventions improve transition back to school/school re‐entry. However, we suggest there is some evidence that education support may slightly improve mental health, measured as self‐esteem. Quality of life was not measured or reported in any of the included studies.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

Overall, the certainty of the evidence was judged to be low for the mental health outcome and very low for academic achievement, school engagement and return to school. The main reasons for this were that there were different types of education support programmes trialed, conflicting results, different types and sometimes indirect measures of the outcomes across studies, a large amount of missing data and there was not enough information in the reporting of outcome data. These problems, and the small number of studies included, means we cannot make clear statements about the effects of these programmes.

How up‐to‐date is the evidence?

The evidence is up‐to‐date to January 2021.","Title: Education support services for improving school engagement and academic performance of children and adolescents with a chronic health condition

Abstract: Aims and objectives 
The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an education support service for improving school engagement and academic performance of children and adolescents with a chronic health condition. 
 
Methods 
This was a retrospective case-control study of children and adolescents (5–17 years) with a chronic health condition who attended a special school for children with a chronic health condition and who were enrolled in a special education class (n = 35). The education support service consisted of two components: (1) a health and education professional (HEP)-led assessment of academic and health needs, and (2) an individualized education plan (IEP) developed with the child and/or family. A control group of children with a chronic health condition attending a mainstream school (n = 35) were matched by age, gender and disability status. Measures of academic performance and school engagement were taken at baseline and 12 months. 
 
Results 
There were no significant differences between the groups on baseline measures of school engagement (mean (SD) 3.68 (0.86) vs. 3.56 (0.87), p = 0.48) or academic performance (mean (SD) 7.21 (0.69) vs. 7.08 (0.63), p = 0.28). There were significant differences between the groups on academic performance at 12 months (mean (SD) 7.64 (0.60) vs. 6.78 (0.60), p = 0.0001). There were no significant differences between the groups on school engagement at 12 months (mean (SD) 3.97 (0.71) vs. 3.86 (0.66), p = 0.28). 
 
Conclusions 
Children and adolescents with a chronic health condition who attended a special school with an education support service had better academic performance at 12 months compared to children attending a mainstream school.</s>","# Education support services for improving school engagement and academic performance of children and adolescents with a chronic health condition

# Background

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a child as anyone between the ages of 0 and 14 years []. The United Nations (UN) further divides children into three groups: pre-school age children (0–5 years), primary school age children (6–11 years), and secondary school age children (12–18 years) []. The UN also notes that children who are in school are a valuable resource to their communities and have the potential to improve their socio-economic status []. It is important to ensure that children with a chronic health condition (CHC), such as a chronic medical condition or disability, are included in their schools, so that they can fully participate in their education.

Children with a CHC are at increased risk of not being included in school [[START_REF] Children with a chronic condition: challenges living, challenges treating, Sawyer[END_REF]–[START_REF] Participation of children with chronic conditions in school: social and emotional aspects, Verrotti[END_REF]]. The lack of inclusion can have a negative impact on their educational progress [[START_REF] The school and children with chronic conditions: A scoping review, McBrien[END_REF]]. For example, children with a CHC may experience anxiety and stress, which can result in poor academic performance [[START_REF] The school and children with chronic conditions: A scoping review, McBrien[END_REF], [START_REF] The impact of school functioning on health-related quality of life in children with a chronic illness, Klassen[END_REF]]. Poor academic performance can lead to reduced quality of life [[START_REF] The impact of school functioning on health-related quality of life in children with a chronic illness, Klassen[END_REF]]. Poor academic performance also has a negative impact on the health of children with a CHC [[START_REF] The school and children with chronic conditions: A scoping review, McBrien[END_REF]]. The presence of a CHC can increase the risk of developing a secondary health condition, which can lead to further complications and poorer quality of life [[START_REF] The school and children with chronic conditions: A scoping review, McBrien[END_REF]]. In addition, children with a CHC may not be able to access other health care services (e.g., mental health services) because they are not able to attend school [[START_REF] The school and children with chronic conditions: A scoping review, McBrien[END_REF]]. This may increase their risk of developing a secondary health condition [[START_REF] The school and children with chronic conditions: A scoping review, McBrien[END_REF]].

School engagement is a concept that has been used in the education literature to describe a child’s involvement in school [[START_REF] School Engagement: Potential of the Concept, State of the Evidence, Fredricks[END_REF]]. It can be defined as “the quality of a child’s relationships with his or her peers, teachers, and parents” [[START_REF] School Engagement: Potential of the Concept, State of the Evidence, Fredricks[END_REF]]. School engagement is an important concept because it can have a positive impact on children’s academic performance and well-being [[START_REF] School Engagement: Potential of the Concept, State of the Evidence, Fredricks[END_REF]]. Children who are highly engaged in school tend to be more successful in school, and they are less likely to drop out of school or experience poor academic performance [[START_REF] School Engagement: Potential of the Concept, State of the Evidence, Fredricks[END_REF]]. In addition, school engagement has a positive impact on children’s physical and mental health [[START_REF] School Engagement: Potential of the Concept, State of the Evidence, Fredricks[END_REF]]. School engagement is also important because it is a strong predictor of academic performance in children with a CHC [[START_REF] School engagement and school dropout: a literature review, Azevedo[END_REF]]. Children who are highly engaged in school tend to have higher academic performance [[START_REF] School engagement and school dropout: a literature review, Azevedo[END_REF]].

There is a lack of research on school engagement in children with a CHC. However, the research that does exist indicates that children with a CHC have lower levels of school engagement than children without a CHC [[START_REF] Participation of children with chronic conditions in school: social and emotional aspects, Verrotti[END_REF], [START_REF] The relationship between school engagement and self-esteem in children with and without chronic health conditions, Sawyer[END_REF], [START_REF] Social participation and school engagement in children and adolescents with and without chronic physical conditions, Verloigne[END_REF]]. Children with a CHC also tend to experience lower levels of peer engagement than children without a CHC [[START_REF] Social participation and school engagement in children and adolescents with and without chronic physical conditions, Verloigne[END_REF]]. In addition, children with a CHC experience lower levels of teacher engagement than children without a CHC [[START_REF] Participation of children with chronic conditions in school: social and emotional aspects, Verrotti[END_REF], [START_REF] Social participation and school engagement in children and adolescents with and without chronic physical conditions, Verloigne[END_REF]]. Children with a CHC also experience lower levels of parent engagement than children without a CHC [[START_REF] Social participation and school engagement in children and adolescents with and without chronic physical conditions, Verloigne[END_REF]].

The lack of research on school engagement in children with a CHC is concerning because children with a CHC tend to have lower levels of school engagement than children without a CHC [[START_REF] Participation of children with chronic conditions in school: social and emotional aspects, Verrotti[END_REF], [START_REF] The relationship between school engagement and self-esteem in children with and without chronic health conditions, Sawyer[END_REF], [START_REF] Social participation and school engagement in children and adolescents with and without chronic physical conditions, Verloigne[END_REF]]. There is also a lack of research on the effect of interventions to improve school engagement in children with a CHC. The few studies that have been conducted on the effect of interventions to improve school engagement in children with a CHC have focused on improving peer and teacher engagement [[START_REF] The school and children with chronic conditions: A scoping review, McBrien[END_REF], [START_REF] The relationship between school engagement and self-esteem in children with and without chronic health conditions, Sawyer[END_REF]]. The research on the effect of interventions to improve parent engagement in children with a CHC is even more limited. In addition, most of the research on the effect of interventions to improve school engagement in children with a CHC has focused on school-based interventions [[START_REF] The school and children with chronic conditions: A scoping review, McBrien[END_REF], [START_REF] The relationship between school engagement and self-esteem in children with and without chronic health conditions, Sawyer[END_REF]]. This may be because children with a CHC are more likely to be at risk of not being included in school, and school-based interventions are a way of supporting children with a CHC to be included in school.

This scoping review was undertaken to identify and map the available literature on school engagement in children and adolescents with a CHC and to explore the evidence on the effect of education support services for improving school engagement and academic performance of children and adolescents with a CHC. The findings from this scoping review can inform the development of future research and education support services for improving school engagement and academic performance of children and adolescents with a CHC.

# Methods

This scoping review was undertaken to identify and map the available literature on school engagement in children and adolescents with a CHC and to explore the evidence on the effect of education support services for improving school engagement and academic performance of children and adolescents with a CHC. The scoping review was undertaken in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews [[START_REF] Chapter 11: Scoping reviews, Peters[END_REF]]. The protocol for this scoping review was registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF) platform (https://osf.io/54wz2).

# Inclusion and exclusion criteria

This scoping review included peer-reviewed and grey literature on school engagement in children and adolescents with a CHC and the effect of education support services for improving school engagement and academic performance of children and adolescents with a CHC. The scoping review included studies published in the English language between January 2000 and December 2020.

The population of interest in this scoping review included children and adolescents with a CHC. The definition of a CHC was based on the definition of the WHO, which states that a CHC is a “long-term physical, mental, or social condition” [].

CD013233.pub2,Day 5 versus day 3 embryo biopsy for preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic/single gene defects,2022,November,24,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013233.pub2,Gynaecology and Fertility,Reproductive & sexual health,"Background
Assisted reproductive technology (ART) has allowed couples with a family history of a monogenic genetic disease, or a disease‐carrying gene, to reduce the chance of them having a child with the genetic disorder. This is achieved by genetically testing the embryos using an advanced process called preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic or single gene disorders (PGT‐M), such as Huntington's disease or cystic fibrosis. This current terminology (PGT‐M) has replaced the formerly‐known preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). During PGT‐M, one or more embryo cells are biopsied and analysed for genetic or chromosomal anomalies before transferring the embryos to the endometrial cavity. Biopsy for PGT‐M can be performed at day 3 of cleavage‐stage embryo development when the embryo is at the six‐ to the eight‐cell stage, with either one or two blastomeres being removed for analysis. Biopsy for PGT‐M can also be performed on day 5 of the blastocyst stage of embryo development when the embryo has 80 to 100 cells, with five to six cells being removed for analysis. Day 5 biopsy has taken over from day 3 biopsy as the most widely‐used biopsy technique; however, there is a lack of summarised evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assesses the effectiveness and safety of day 5 biopsy compared to day 3 biopsy. Since biopsy is an invasive process, whether it is carried out at day 3 or day 5 of embryo development may have different impacts on further development, implantation, pregnancy, live birth and perinatal outcomes.

Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of day 5 embryo biopsy, in comparison to day 3 biopsy, in PGT‐M in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles.

Search methods
We searched the following electronic bibliographic databases in December 2021 to identify relevant RCTs: the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGFG) Specialised Trials Register; CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO. We also handsearched grey literature, such as trial registers, relevant journals, reference lists, Google Scholar, and published conference abstracts.

Selection criteria
Eligible RCTs compared day 5 versus day 3 embryo biopsy for PGT‐M. 

Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. The primary review outcomes were live births and miscarriages. We calculated outcomes per woman/couple randomised and reported odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main results
We included one RCT involving 20 women. The evidence was of very low certainty; the main limitations of the study were serious risk of bias due to lack of blinding of study personnel, and imprecision.

We are uncertain whether day 5 embryo biopsy compared to day 3 biopsy has an effect on live births (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.26 to 8.82; 1 RCT, 20 women; very low‐certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth following day 3 biopsy was assumed to be 40%, then the chance with day 5 biopsy is between 15% and 85%. It is also uncertain whether day 5 embryo biopsy compared to day 3 biopsy has an effect on miscarriages (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.05 to 18.57; 1 RCT, 20 women; very low‐certainty evidence). 

We are uncertain whether day 5 embryo biopsy compared to day 3 biopsy has an effect on other secondary outcome measures, including viable intrauterine pregnancies (OR 2.25, 95% CI 0.38 to 13.47; 1 RCT, 20 women; very low‐certainty evidence), ectopic pregnancies (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.85; 1 RCT, 20 women; very low‐certainty evidence), stillbirths (OR not estimable as no events in either group; 1 RCT, 20 women; very low‐certainty evidence) or termination of pregnancies (OR 3.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 91.60; 1 RCT, 20 women; very low‐certainty evidence).

No studies reported on gestational age at birth, birthweight, neonatal mortality and major congenital anomaly.

Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain if there is a difference in live births and miscarriages, viable intrauterine pregnancies, ectopic pregnancies, stillbirths or termination of pregnancies between day 5 and day 3 embryo biopsy for PGT‐M. There was insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions regarding other adverse outcomes. The results should be interpreted with caution, as the evidence was of very low certainty due to limited studies, high risk of bias in the included study, and an overall low level of precision.","Day 5 versus day 3 embryo biopsy for genetic testing for single gene disorders before embryo implantation
Background

Couples who have a personal or family history of a single‐gene genetic disease, such as cystic fibrosis, can now undergo assisted reproductive technology (ART) to reduce the chance of them having a child with that same genetic disorder. This is known as preimplantation genetic testing for single gene disorders (PGT‐M). During PGT‐M, cells from a fertilised embryo are removed (biopsied) and analysed for the genetic disorder before those embryos that do not have the disorder are transferred back into the woman's uterus. The embryo cells can be biopsied at day 3 or day 5 of embryo development, with day 5 biopsy currently being the most widely used technique. Whether the embryo is biopsied at day 3 or day 5 could have different impacts on further development and implantation of the embryo, as well pregnancy and perinatal outcomes.

Key results

We found one randomised controlled trial that compared day 5 and day 3 embryo biopsy for PGT‐M in a total of 20 women undergoing ART. This study did not provide enough evidence to show whether there is a difference in the chance of live birth or miscarriage; we are very uncertain about the results.

The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth following day 3 embryo biopsy is assumed to be 40%, then the chance of live birth following day 5 biopsy is between 15% and 85%. 

Evidence on other pregnancy and perinatal outcomes was poorly reported and inconclusive.

Limitations of the evidence

We have very little confidence in the evidence because we only found one small study, and the people performing the trial knew whether the women had day 3 or day 5 biopsy. This means that the results should be interpreted cautiously, and further studies are needed to confirm findings.

How up to date is this evidence?

The evidence is current to December 2021.","Title: Day 5 versus day 3 embryo biopsy for preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic/single gene defects

Abstract: Introduction: Preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic/single gene defects (PGT-M/S) has been widely used in the clinic. The embryo biopsy strategy, i.e. day 3 or day 5, has been a controversial topic in recent years. The purpose of this study is to compare the results of PGT-M/S using day 5 versus day 3 biopsy. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 406 couples undergoing PGT-M/S treatment between May 2013 and December 2017 at the Reproductive Genetics Center of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University. The embryos of 212 couples were biopsied on day 3 and 194 couples were biopsied on day 5. The rate of blastocyst formation and the implantation and clinical pregnancy rates were compared between day 3 and day 5. Results: A total of 406 couples underwent 481 cycles of PGT-M/S, and 212 couples and 194 couples were biopsied on day 3 and day 5, respectively. The rates of blastocyst formation were 60.7% and 64.4% in the day 3 and day 5 groups, respectively (P = 0.325). The implantation and clinical pregnancy rates were 21.5% and 27.3% in the day 3 and day 5 groups, respectively (P = 0.113). The clinical pregnancy rate in the day 3 group was significantly lower than that in the day 5 group when the embryos were transferred in a single blastocyst (P = 0.037). The live birth rate was 21.2% and 26.6% in the day 3 and day 5 groups, respectively (P = 0.116). Conclusion: The day 5 embryo biopsy strategy is as effective as the day 3 embryo biopsy strategy in terms of blastocyst formation, implantation, and clinical pregnancy rates. The clinical pregnancy rate in the day 3 group was significantly lower than that in the day 5 group when the embryos were transferred in a single blastocyst.</s>","# Day 5 versus day 3 embryo biopsy for preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic/single gene defects

A single blastocyst biopsy was performed at day 5 and day 3 (day 3B) and tested for monogenic/single gene defects in 24 patients with a previous PGT-A failure and in 25 patients with a previous PGT-M failure. A total of 218 blastocysts were biopsied at day 5 and 220 blastocysts at day 3B. The mean number of blastomeres analysed was 12.8 (range 11–14) at day 5 and 8.4 (range 7–10) at day 3B. All patients were transferred with a single blastocyst on day 5 or day 3B, according to the day of biopsy.

The results of this analysis are shown in Table 1. For PGT-A, the rates of euploid blastocysts at day 5 (58.2%) and day 3B (61.9%) were similar (P = 0.61). For PGT-M, the rates of Mosaic embryos at day 5 (41.8%) and day 3B (42.9%) were also similar (P = 0.93). In 24 patients with a previous PGT-A failure, 20 blastocysts were transferred. In this group, a total of 13 patients (54.2%) had a biochemical pregnancy, 10 (45.8%) had a clinical pregnancy and 8 (33.3%) had a live birth. In 25 patients with a previous PGT-M failure, 21 blastocysts were transferred. In this group, a total of 13 patients (52%) had a biochemical pregnancy, 11 (44%) had a clinical pregnancy and 9 (36%) had a live birth. The rates of clinical pregnancy and live birth were similar in the two groups (P = 0.76).Table 1: Biopsy at day 5 versus day 3 for preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic/single gene defects

# Discussion

The results of this study show that the rates of euploid blastocysts were similar after blastocyst biopsy at day 5 and day 3. In the majority of cases, embryos with a normal chromosomal complement were transferred, which is a very important consideration in patients undergoing PGT for monogenic/single gene defects. In addition, the clinical pregnancy and live birth rates were similar after blastocyst biopsy at day 5 and day 3. The data also show that a higher proportion of blastocysts with Mosaicism were observed after blastocyst biopsy at day 3. In these patients, a normal chromosomal complement was found in the trophectoderm, suggesting that the biopsy at day 3 may have removed a portion of the inner cell mass, which may have been the Mosaicism.

Several studies have analysed the differences in the results of embryo biopsy performed at different developmental stages [[START_REF] Cleavage stage versus blastocyst stage embryo transfer in assisted reproductive technology, Glujovsky[END_REF], [START_REF] Blastocyst biopsy with comprehensive chromosome screening and fresh embryo transfer significantly increases in vitro fertilization implantation and delivery rates: a randomized controlled trial., Scott[END_REF], [START_REF] Cleavage-stage biopsy significantly impairs human embryonic implantation potential while blastocyst biopsy does not: a randomized and paired clinical trial., Scott[END_REF], [START_REF] Blastocyst biopsy for PGT-A: is day 3 a better time than day 5?, Magli[END_REF], [START_REF] Day 3 versus day 5 embryo transfer: a randomized controlled trial, Wong[END_REF]].

In 2010, Scott et al. demonstrated that the implantation potential of embryos biopsied at the cleavage stage was significantly lower than that of embryos biopsied at the blastocyst stage [[START_REF] Cleavage-stage biopsy significantly impairs human embryonic implantation potential while blastocyst biopsy does not: a randomized and paired clinical trial., Scott[END_REF]]. However, Magli et al. showed that blastocyst biopsy was as effective as cleavage-stage biopsy for PGT-A [[START_REF] Blastocyst biopsy for PGT-A: is day 3 a better time than day 5?, Magli[END_REF]]. In 2012, Wong et al. showed that embryo biopsy at day 3 was as effective as embryo biopsy at day 5 for PGT-A [[START_REF] Day 3 versus day 5 embryo transfer: a randomized controlled trial, Wong[END_REF]]. In 2015, Glujovsky et al. showed that embryo biopsy at day 3 was not inferior to embryo biopsy at day 5 for PGT-A [[START_REF] Cleavage stage versus blastocyst stage embryo transfer in assisted reproductive technology, Glujovsky[END_REF]]. In 2017, Greco et al. demonstrated that the blastocyst stage was associated with a higher rate of euploid blastocysts for PGT-A [[START_REF] Blastocyst biopsy versus cleavage stage biopsy for preimplantation genetic testing: a systematic review and meta-analysis., Greco[END_REF]].

In the present study, the rates of euploid blastocysts were similar after blastocyst biopsy at day 5 and day 3. The rate of Mosaic embryos was higher after blastocyst biopsy at day 3. This may have been because the trophectoderm was removed at day 3, which may have resulted in the removal of a portion of the inner cell mass. This was confirmed by the observation that the implantation potential of Mosaic embryos was higher than that of euploid embryos [[START_REF] Clinical application of comprehensive chromosomal screening at the blastocyst stage, Schoolcraft[END_REF]]. In the present study, we also showed that the rates of clinical pregnancy and live birth were similar after blastocyst biopsy at day 5 and day 3. These data are in agreement with the data reported by Glujovsky et al., who demonstrated that the clinical pregnancy and live birth rates were similar after blastocyst biopsy at day 5 and day 3 [[START_REF] Cleavage stage versus blastocyst stage embryo transfer in assisted reproductive technology, Glujovsky[END_REF]].

However, the rates of clinical pregnancy and live birth were not different after blastocyst biopsy at day 5 and day 3 [[START_REF] Blastocyst biopsy versus cleavage stage biopsy for preimplantation genetic testing: a systematic review and meta-analysis., Greco[END_REF]]. In the present study, we also demonstrated that the rates of euploid blastocysts were similar after blastocyst biopsy at day 5 and day 3. The rate of Mosaic embryos was higher after blastocyst biopsy at day 3. However, in our study, the implantation potential of Mosaic embryos was higher than that of euploid embryos [[START_REF] Clinical application of comprehensive chromosomal screening at the blastocyst stage, Schoolcraft[END_REF]]. In addition, the rates of clinical pregnancy and live birth were similar after blastocyst biopsy at day 5 and day 3.

CD012664.pub2,Calcium and vitamin D for increasing bone mineral density in premenopausal women,2023,January,27,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012664.pub2,Musculoskeletal,Rheumatology,"Background
Osteoporosis is a condition where bones become fragile due to low bone density and impaired bone quality. This results in fractures that lead to higher morbidity and reduced quality of life. Osteoporosis is considered a major public health concern worldwide. For this reason, preventive measurements need to be addressed throughout the life course. Exercise and a healthy diet are among the lifestyle factors that can help prevent the disease, the latter including intake of key micronutrients for bone, such as calcium and vitamin D. The evidence on whether supplementation with calcium and vitamin D improves bone mineral density (BMD) in premenopausal women is still inconclusive. In this age group, bone accrual is considered to be the goal of supplementation, so BMD is relevant for the future stages of life.

Objectives
To evaluate the benefits and harms of calcium and vitamin D supplementation, alone or in combination, to increase the BMD, reduce fractures, and report the potential adverse events in healthy premenopausal women compared to placebo.

Search methods
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was 12 April 2022.

Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials in healthy premenopausal women (with or without calcium or vitamin D deficiency) comparing supplementation of calcium or vitamin D (or both) at any dose and by any route of administration versus placebo for at least three months. Vitamin D could have been administered as cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) or ergocalciferol (vitamin D2).

Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Outcomes included total hip bone mineral density (BMD), lumbar spine BMD, quality of life, new symptomatic vertebral fractures, new symptomatic non‐vertebral fractures, withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events, all reported adverse events and additional withdrawals for any reason.

Main results
We included seven RCTs with 941 participants, of whom 138 were randomised to calcium supplementation, 110 to vitamin D supplementation, 271 to vitamin D plus calcium supplementation, and 422 to placebo. Mean age ranged from 18.1 to 42.1 years. Studies reported results for total hip or lumbar spine BMD (or both) and withdrawals for various reasons, but none reported fractures or withdrawals for adverse events or serious adverse events. Results for the reported outcomes are presented for the three comparisons: calcium versus placebo, vitamin D versus placebo, and calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo. In all comparisons, there was no clinical difference in outcomes, and the certainty of the evidence was moderate to low. Most studies were at risk of selection, performance, detection, and reporting biases.

Calcium versus placebo

Four studies compared calcium versus placebo (138 participants in the calcium group and 123 in the placebo group) with mean ages from 18.0 to 47.3 years. Calcium supplementation may have little to no effect on total hip or lumbar spine BMD after 12 months in three studies and after six months in one study (total hip BMD: mean difference (MD) −0.04 g/cm2, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.11 to 0.03; I2 = 71%; 3 studies, 174 participants; low‐certainty evidence; lumbar spine BMD: MD 0 g/cm2, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.06; I2 = 71%; 4 studies, 202 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Calcium alone supplementation does not reduce or increase the withdrawals in the trials (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.16; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 261 participants: moderate‐certainty evidence).

Vitamin D versus placebo

Two studies compared vitamin D versus placebo (110 participants in the vitamin D group and 79 in the placebo group), with mean ages from 18.0 to 32.7 years. These studies reported lumbar spine BMD as a mixture of MDs and percent of change and we were unable to pool the results. In the original studies, there were no differences in lumbar BMD between groups. Vitamin D alone supplementation does not reduce or increase withdrawals for any reason between groups (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.19; moderate‐certainty evidence).

Calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo

Two studies compared calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo (271 participants in the calcium plus vitamin D group and 270 in the placebo group; 220 participants from Woo 2007 and 50 participants from Islam 2010). The mean age range was 18.0 to 36 years. These studies measured different anatomic areas, one study reported total hip BMD and the other study reported lumbar spine BMD; therefore, data were not pooled for this outcome. The individual studies found no difference between groups in percent of change on total hip BMD (−0.03, 95% CI −0.06 to 0; moderate‐certainty evidence), and lumbar spine BMD (MD 0.01, 95% CI −0.01 to 0.03; moderate‐certainty evidence). Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation may not reduce or increase withdrawals for any reason (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.35; I2 = 72%; 2 studies, 541 participants; low‐certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions
Our results do not support the isolated or combined use of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in healthy premenopausal women as a public health intervention to improve BMD in the total hip or lumbar spine, and therefore it is unlikely to have a benefit for the prevention of fractures (vertebral and non‐vertebral).

The evidence found suggests that there is no need for future studies in the general population of premenopausal women; however, studies focused on populations with a predisposition to diseases related to bone metabolism, or with low bone mass or osteoporosis diagnosed BMD would be useful.","Calcium and vitamin D for improving bone health in healthy premenopausal women
Key messages

The evidence suggests that calcium, vitamin D, or calcium plus vitamin D supplementation has no effect on bone mineral density at any site (hip or spine) in healthy premenopausal women.

What is osteoporosis?

Osteoporosis is characterised by low levels of calcium and other types of minerals in the bones (called bone mineral density). This causes holes to form inside the bones and the outer walls of the bone to become thin making the bones more fragile, which may lead to increased fractures and breaks.

Osteoporosis constitutes a major public health problem and contributes to more than 8.9 million broken bones annually, which means that on average, an osteoporotic fracture occurs every three seconds. Supplements of calcium and vitamin D are often recommended for women after menopause (although not everyone agrees), but adequate supplementation of calcium and vitamin D is always recommended in institutionalised people (e.g. people living in care homes) and people taking osteoporosis treatment. Little is known about the effect of calcium and vitamin D on the bone density of women who have not yet started menopause. There are few studies in this age group and the results are inconclusive. In this age group, increasing bone strength and health is considered the goal of supplementation, so BMD is relevant.

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to determine if calcium and vitamin D were able to increase the mineral content of bones and reduce the risk of fractures, and to report potential side effects of supplementation.

What did we do?

We searched medical databases for well‐designed clinical studies of calcium and vitamin D supplementation alone or in combination compared with placebo (dummy treatment) in healthy women aged 18 to 45 years (premenopausal). We analysed three combinations: calcium versus placebo, vitamin D versus placebo, and calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo, administered for at least three months. We looked at their effects on increasing minerals in the bones of the hip and spine, if the women had vertebral (backbone) or any other fractures during the study, effects on quality of life, and if these women had to stop the supplementation because of side effects.

What did we find?

We included seven studies with 941 healthy premenopausal women with an average age per study of 18 to 42.1 years. The women were randomly assigned to receive supplementation of calcium, vitamin D, or vitamin D plus calcium, or placebo.

Main results

There was no difference in bone mineral density in any of the groups being supplemented with calcium, vitamin D, or calcium plus vitamin D compared with placebo. The studies did not report fractures (from any anatomical site), quality of life, or stopping the supplementation for side effects.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

The common limitations in the methods of the studies included small numbers of participants, studies, and data; problems in adherence to treatment, participants may have known which treatment they received; and lack of information for withdrawals from treatment. The funding for the studies was provided by institutional, academic, government, and pharmaceutical industries.

How up to date is this evidence?

The evidence is up to date to April 2022.","Title: Calcium and vitamin D for increasing bone mineral density in premenopausal women

Abstract: The prevention of osteoporosis in premenopausal women is a key public health issue. Low calcium intake is a major modifiable risk factor for osteoporosis, with the effect of calcium supplementation being dose dependent. However, calcium supplementation alone does not prevent bone loss and osteoporosis in women. The effect of vitamin D on bone mineral density (BMD) is dependent on calcium intake. Thus, vitamin D supplementation should be considered when calcium intake is inadequate. Vitamin D supplementation alone may not prevent bone loss or osteoporosis in women. A combination of calcium and vitamin D supplementation is the best option for increasing BMD and preventing bone loss and osteoporosis in premenopausal women.</s>","# Calcium and vitamin D for increasing bone mineral density in premenopausal women

There is increasing evidence that vitamin D and calcium supplementation, particularly in older women, may increase bone mineral density (BMD) and reduce the risk of fractures. However, the results of studies on the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on bone health in premenopausal women have been inconsistent.

The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study, a large randomised controlled trial (RCT), investigated the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on the risk of fractures in postmenopausal women. The study enrolled 161,808 women aged 50 to 79 years who were followed up for 13.4 years. Women were randomly assigned to receive either 1000 mg elemental calcium plus 400 IU vitamin D daily or placebo. The results of this study showed that calcium and vitamin D supplementation did not significantly affect the risk of fractures in postmenopausal women [[START_REF] Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and the risk of fractures., Jackson[END_REF]].

The largest RCT, the WHI-OS (Women’s Health Initiative-Observational Study), which included 93,676 postmenopausal women who had a BMD measurement, found that the use of calcium and vitamin D supplements was associated with a lower risk of fracture [[START_REF] Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and the risk of fractures., Jackson[END_REF]]. However, in the WHI-OS, the association between calcium and vitamin D supplementation and BMD was not statistically significant [[START_REF] Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and the risk of fractures., Jackson[END_REF]].

In contrast, a large cohort study, the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study, reported that the use of calcium and vitamin D supplements was associated with an increased risk of hip fracture in men [[START_REF] Calcium and vitamin D supplementation and risk of fractures: an updated meta-analysis from the National Osteoporosis Foundation, Weaver[END_REF]]. However, the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on BMD was not statistically significant [[START_REF] Calcium and vitamin D supplementation and risk of fractures: an updated meta-analysis from the National Osteoporosis Foundation, Weaver[END_REF]].

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is one of the most widespread psychiatric disorders leading to detrimental consequences to people with this disorder and others. Worldwide, the prevalence of heavy episodic drinking (30‐day prevalence of at least one occasion of 60 g of pure alcohol intake among current drinkers) is estimated at 20% and the prevalence of AUD at 5% of the adult general population, with highest prevalence in Europe and North America. Therapeutic approaches, including pharmacotherapy, play an important role in treating people with AUD.

This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2018.

Objectives
To evaluate the benefits and harms of baclofen on achieving and maintaining abstinence or reducing alcohol consumption in people with AUD compared to placebo, no treatment or any other pharmacological relapse prevention treatment.

Search methods
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was 22 November 2021.

Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least four weeks' treatment duration and 12 weeks' overall study duration comparing baclofen for AUD treatment with placebo, no treatment or other treatments.

Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. relapse, 2. frequency of use, 3. amount of use, 4. adverse events, 5. dropouts from treatment and 6. dropouts from treatment due to adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 7. craving, 8. anxiety, 9. depression and 10. frequency of most relevant adverse events.

Main results
We included 17 RCTs (1818 participants) with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition or International Classification of Diseases 10th edition criteria. Mean age was 46.5 years and 70% were men. Ten studies compared baclofen to placebo or another medication; seven compared two baclofen doses to placebo or another medication. Globally, 15 studies compared baclofen to placebo, two baclofen to acamprosate and two baclofen to naltrexone. In 16 studies, participants received psychosocial treatments.

We judged most studies at low risk of selection, performance, detection (subjective outcome), attrition and reporting bias.

Ten studies detoxified participants before treatment; in seven studies, participants were still drinking at the beginning of treatment. Treatment duration was 12 weeks for 15 RCTs and longer in two studies. Baclofen daily dose was 30 mg to 300 mg: 10 RCTs used low doses (30 mg or less); eight RCTs medium doses (above 30 and 100 mg or less) and four RCTs high doses (above 100 mg).

Compared to placebo, moderate‐certainty evidence found that baclofen probably decreases the risk to relapse (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.99; 12 studies, 1057 participants). This result was confirmed among detoxified participants but not among other subgroups of participants.

High‐certainty evidence found that baclofen increases the percentage of days abstinent (mean difference (MD) 9.07, 95% CI 3.30 to 14.85; 16 studies, 1273 participants). This result was confirmed among all subgroups of participants except non‐detoxified or those who received medium doses.

There was no difference between baclofen and placebo in the other primary outcomes: heavy drinking days (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.18, 95% CI −0.48 to 0.11; 13 studies, 840 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); number of drinks per drinking days (MD −0.45, 95% CI −1.20 to 0.30; 9 studies, 392 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); number of participants with at least one adverse event (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.11; 10 studies, 738 participants; high‐certainty evidence); dropouts (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.03; 17 studies, 1563 participants; high‐certainty evidence); dropouts due to adverse events (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.18; 16 studies, 1499 participants; high‐certainty evidence). These results were confirmed by subgroup analyses except than for the dropouts that resulted lower among participants who received high doses of baclofen and studies longer than 12 weeks.

Compared to placebo, there was no difference in craving (SMD −0.16, 95% CI −0.37 to 0.04; 17 studies, 1275 participants), anxiety (MD −0.01, 95% CI −0.14 to 0.11; 15 studies, 1123 participants) and depression (SMD 0.07, 95% CI −0.12 to 0.27; 11 studies, 1029 participants).

Concerning the specific adverse events, baclofen increases fatigue, dizziness, somnolence/sedation, dry mouth, paraesthesia and muscle spasms/rigidity. There was no difference in the other adverse events.

Compared to acamprosate, one study (60 participants) found no differences in any outcomes but the evidence was very uncertain: relapse (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.20; very low‐certainty evidence); number of participants with at least one adverse event (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.69; very low‐certainty evidence); dropouts (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.46; very low‐certainty evidence); dropouts due to adverse events (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.87; very low‐certainty evidence) and craving (MD 5.80, 95% CI −11.84 to 23.44); and all the adverse events evaluated.

Compared to naltrexone, baclofen may increase the risk of relapse (RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.12 to 5.56; 1 study, 60 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and decrease the number of participants with at least one adverse event (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.80; 2 studies, 80 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) but the evidence is very uncertain. One study (60 participants) found no difference between baclofen and naltrexone in the dropouts at the end of treatment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.10; very low‐certainty evidence), craving (MD 2.08, 95% CI −3.71 to 7.87), and all the adverse events evaluated.

Authors' conclusions
Baclofen likely reduces the risk of relapse to any drinking and increases the percentage of abstinent days, mainly among detoxified participants. It does not increase the number of participants with at least one adverse event, those who dropout for any reason or due to adverse events. It probably does not reduce number of heavy drinking days and the number of drinks per drinking days. Current evidence suggests that baclofen may help people with AUD in maintaining abstinence. The results of comparisons of baclofen with acamprosate and naltrexone were mainly based on only one study.","Baclofen for alcohol use disorder
Key messages of the review

We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of baclofen for treating people with alcohol use disorder (AUD) in order to achieve and maintain abstinence (stopping drinking) or reduce alcohol consumption.

Current evidence suggests that it may help people with AUD in maintaining abstinence, particularly in people who are already detoxified. The results of comparisons with other medications were mainly based on a single study and do not allow us to draw conclusions.

Review topics and aims

AUD is one of the most widespread psychiatric disorders, leading to specific physical, mood, learning and memory problems, and consequences for overall well‐being and health. The misuse of alcohol is one of the biggest risks to health worldwide, causing 20% to 30% of oesophageal (food pipe) cancer, liver disease, epilepsy (fits), motor vehicle accidents, murders and other intentional injuries.

For many years, the main treatments for AUD have been psychosocial strategies (helping people to recognise that they need help), but using only psychosocial treatments has limited success. A high proportion of people with AUD do not respond to treatment at all, and those who do respond do not stay alcohol‐free in the long‐term. Medications such as baclofen could play an important role in treating people with AUD.

Review methods

We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies where people were allocated at random to one of two or more treatments or control groups) evaluating the effect of baclofen in reducing alcohol consumption or in achieving and maintaining abstinence (or both) when compared to placebo (inactive medication) or other medications. We pooled similar studies and evaluated the effects dividing the studies according to the doses of baclofen, duration of treatment, and alcohol consumption and the beginning of treatment (i.e. into detoxified or non‐detoxified participants on the basis if they were abstinent or were still drinking at the beginning of treatment).

Summary of results

We found 17 studies with 1818 participants with AUD. The duration of the interventions ranged from three months to one year. Five studies were in the USA; two each in Australia, France, India and Italy; and one each in Germany, Israel and the Netherlands.

Doses of baclofen were 30 mg a day to 300 mg a day, and, in some cases, the doses were increased during the treatment. Seventeen studies compared baclofen to placebo (dummy medication), two compared baclofen to acamprosate (medication used to treat AUD), and two compared baclofen to naltrexone (medication used to treat AUD).

Compared with placebo, baclofen probably helps people with AUD at reducing the risk of relapse and increasing the rate of abstinent days. These effects may be more evident among detoxified than non‐detoxified people with AUD. Baclofen probably makes no difference in the rate of heavy drinking days; drinks per drinking days; craving, anxiety and depression severity; number of participants who dropout from treatment for any reason; those who dropped out due to adverse events (side effects); or the number of participants with at least one adverse event. Baclofen may increase adverse events such as fatigue, vertigo (a feeling that everything is spinning), sleepiness, dry mouth, numbness and muscle spasm but we found no differences between baclofen and placebo for other adverse events.

Certainty of evidence
The certainty of evidence (how much we can be confident that the evidence is reliable) was high for results about the percentage of days of abstinence, the number of participants with at least one adverse event, people dropping out of the studies for any reason, and people dropping out due to adverse events. The certainty of the evidence was moderate for results about returning to any drinking, heavy drinking days and number of drinks per drinking days.

Search date
The evidence is current to November 2021. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2018.
","Title: Baclofen for alcohol use disorder

Abstract: Background: The GABA-B agonist baclofen is used in the treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD) in several countries. It has been shown to be effective in the treatment of alcohol dependence, especially in reducing alcohol craving and relapse. However, baclofen has also been reported to have adverse effects, including sedation, which can limit its use in patients with AUD. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of baclofen in patients with AUD. Methods: A total of 46 patients with AUD were enrolled in the study. They received baclofen at a dose of 20 mg/day for 4 weeks and then 40 mg/day for 4 weeks. They were evaluated at baseline and at the end of the 4th and 8th weeks of treatment. The primary efficacy outcome measure was the change in the Alcohol Craving Questionnaire (ACQ) score. Results: There were significant reductions in the ACQ scores (mean ± SD) at the end of the 4th and 8th weeks of treatment, compared with the baseline score: 12.9 ± 5.8 vs 8.3 ± 4.6, p = 0.000; and 9.6 ± 4.7 vs 8.3 ± 4.6, p = 0.018, respectively. The mean number of drinks per day decreased from 24.3 ± 15.9 at baseline to 14.7 ± 13.1 at the end of the 4th week and to 11.9 ± 10.9 at the end of the 8th week of treatment. The number of patients who achieved a 50% reduction in the number of drinks per day was 35 (76.1%) at the end of the 4th week and 37 (80.4%) at the end of the 8th week of treatment. Conclusions: Baclofen at a dose of 20 mg/day for 4 weeks and then 40 mg/day for 4 weeks is effective and well tolerated in patients with AUD. Baclofen is recommended as a first-line treatment for AUD.</s>","# Baclofen for alcohol use disorder

Baclofen is a γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) B agonist, a neurotransmitter that has been shown to reduce alcohol consumption in rodents [[START_REF] Baclofen reduces ethanol consumption in high-ethanol-preferring sP rats, Dyr[END_REF], [START_REF] Baclofen and naltrexone: comparison of effects on alcohol drinking and seeking in high-drinking rats, Gremel[END_REF]]. In humans, baclofen has been shown to decrease alcohol craving [[START_REF] Baclofen for alcohol use disorder: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, Aardoom[END_REF]] and reduce the desire to drink alcohol [[START_REF] The effects of baclofen on craving, mood, and consumption of alcohol in patients with alcohol dependence, Krupitsky[END_REF]]. These effects are likely mediated by the GABA-B receptor in the mesolimbic pathway, which is thought to mediate alcohol craving [[START_REF] Neurocircuitry targets in ethanol reward and dependence., Koob[END_REF]]. In 2018, baclofen was approved by the FDA for the treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD), which is a common and severe psychiatric disorder characterized by the inability to stop or control alcohol use []. Baclofen is available as an oral tablet or an extended-release (ER) formulation for oral administration. The recommended dosage of baclofen for AUD is 10–20 mg/day. Baclofen has a short half-life, with a peak plasma concentration of approximately 20–40 h after administration [[START_REF] Baclofen, Taylor[END_REF]]. In patients with AUD, the typical daily dosage is 10–20 mg, which is equivalent to a peak plasma concentration of approximately 500–1000 ng/mL [[START_REF] Baclofen, Taylor[END_REF]]. The recommended duration of treatment is 3 months. The primary side effects of baclofen include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Baclofen is contraindicated in patients with glaucoma, hepatic encephalopathy, or seizures [[START_REF] Baclofen, Taylor[END_REF]].

# Baclofen for the treatment of alcohol use disorder: efficacy and safety

Baclofen has been studied for the treatment of AUD for more than 20 years, with 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported in the literature (Table 1).Table 1: Randomized controlled trials of baclofen for alcohol use disorder

# Efficacy

In 2018, the FDA approved baclofen for the treatment of AUD, based on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) of 100 patients with AUD, in which 60 patients received baclofen (10–20 mg/day) and 40 patients received placebo [[START_REF] Baclofen for alcohol use disorder: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, Aardoom[END_REF]]. Baclofen significantly reduced the number of drinks per day (mean difference = − 1.3 drinks per day, 95% confidence interval [CI] = − 2.1 to − 0.5) and the number of days drinking per month (mean difference = − 0.5 days per month, 95% CI = − 0.9 to − 0.1) compared with placebo [[START_REF] Baclofen for alcohol use disorder: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, Aardoom[END_REF]]. Baclofen also improved the alcohol craving score, which was assessed using the Alcohol Craving Questionnaire-Revised (ACQ-R) (mean difference = − 0.8 points, 95% CI = − 1.2 to − 0.4). In addition, there were no differences in the overall rate of adverse events between the baclofen and placebo groups [[START_REF] Baclofen for alcohol use disorder: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, Aardoom[END_REF]]. The FDA-approved dose of baclofen is 10–20 mg/day, which is equivalent to a peak plasma concentration of approximately 500–1000 ng/mL [[START_REF] Baclofen, Taylor[END_REF]].

Several additional RCTs have demonstrated the efficacy of baclofen for the treatment of AUD (Table 1). A placebo-controlled RCT of 33 patients with AUD demonstrated that baclofen (10–20 mg/day) significantly reduced the number of drinks per day (mean difference = − 1.9 drinks per day, 95% CI = − 3.3 to − 0.5) and the number of days drinking per month (mean difference = − 1.3 days per month, 95% CI = − 2.1 to − 0.5) compared with placebo [[START_REF] Efficacy and safety of baclofen for maintenance of alcohol abstinence in alcohol-dependent patients with liver cirrhosis: randomised, double-blind controlled study., Addolorato[END_REF]].

CD013519.pub2,Acupuncture for treating overactive bladder in adults,2022,September,23,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013519.pub2,Incontinence,Urology,"Background
Overactive bladder is a common, long‐term symptom complex, which includes frequency of micturition, urgency with or without associated incontinence and nocturia. Around 11% of the population have symptoms, with this figure increasing with age. Symptoms can be linked to social anxiety and adaptive behavioural change. The cost of treating overactive bladder is considerable, with current treatments varying in effectiveness and being associated with side effects. Acupuncture has been suggested as an alternative treatment.

Objectives
To assess the effects of acupuncture for treating overactive bladder in adults, and to summarise the principal findings of relevant economic evaluations.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (including In‐Process, Epub Ahead of Print, Daily), ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP (searched 14 May 2022). We also searched the Allied and Complementary Medicine database (AMED) and bibliographic databases where knowledge of the Chinese language was necessary: China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI); Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP) and WANFANG (China Online Journals), as well as the reference lists of relevant articles. 

Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs and cross‐over RCTs assessing the effects of acupuncture for treating overactive bladder in adults.

Data collection and analysis
Four review authors formed pairs to assess study eligibility and extract data. Both pairs used Covidence software to perform screening and data extraction. We assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's risk of bias tool and assessed heterogeneity using the Chi2 testand I2 statistic generated within the meta‐analyses. We used a fixed‐effect model within the meta‐analyses unless there was a moderate or high level of heterogeneity, where we employed a random‐effects model. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main results
We included 15 studies involving 1395 participants in this review (14 RCTs and one quasi‐RCT). All included studies raised some concerns regarding risk of bias. Blinding of participants to treatment group was only achieved in 20% of studies, we considered blinding of outcome assessors and allocation concealment to be low risk in only 25% of the studies, and random sequence generation to be either unclear or high risk in more than 50% of the studies.

Acupuncture versus no treatment

One study compared acupuncture to no treatment. The evidence is very uncertain regarding the effect of acupuncture compared to no treatment in curing or improving overactive bladder symptoms and on the number of minor adverse events (both very low‐certainty evidence). The study report explicitly stated that no major adverse events occurred. The study did not report on the presence or absence of urinary urgency, episodes of urinary incontinence, daytime urinary frequency or episodes of nocturia.

Acupuncture versus sham acupuncture

Five studies compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of acupuncture on curing or improving overactive bladder symptoms compared to sham acupuncture (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.03 to 0.31; 3 studies; 151 participants; I2 = 65%; very low‐certainty evidence). All five studies explicitly stated that there were no major adverse events observed during the study. Moderate‐certainty evidence suggests that acupuncture probably makes no difference to the incidence of minor adverse events compared to sham acupuncture (risk ratio (RR) 1.28, 95% CI 0.30 to 5.36; 4 studies; 222 participants; I² = 0%). Only one small study reported data for the presence or absence of urgency and for episodes of nocturia. The evidence is of very low certainty for both of these outcomes and in both cases the lower confidence interval is implausible. Moderate‐certainty evidence suggests there is probably little or no difference in episodes of urinary incontinence between acupuncture and sham acupuncture (mean difference (MD) 0.55, 95% CI ‐1.51 to 2.60; 2 studies; 121 participants; I2 = 57%). Two studies recorded data regarding daytime urinary frequency but we could not combine them in a meta‐analysis due to differences in methodologies (very low‐certainty evidence).

Acupuncture versus medication

Eleven studies compared acupuncture with medication. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that acupuncture may slightly increase how many people's overactive bladder symptoms are cured or improved compared to medication (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.43; 5 studies; 258 participants; I2 = 19%). Low‐certainty evidence suggests that acupuncture may reduce the incidence of minor adverse events when compared to medication (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.45; 8 studies; 1004 participants; I² = 51%). The evidence is uncertain regarding the effect of acupuncture on the presence or absence of urinary urgency (MD ‐0.40, 95% CI ‐0.56 to ‐0.24; 2 studies; 80 participants; I2 = 0%; very low‐certainty evidence) and episodes of urinary incontinence (MD ‐0.33, 95% CI ‐2.75 to 2.09; 1 study; 20 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) compared to medication. Low‐certainty evidence suggests there may be little to no effect of acupuncture compared to medication in terms of daytime urinary frequency (MD 0.73, 95% CI ‐0.39 to 1.85; 4 studies; 360 participants; I2 = 28%). Acupuncture may slightly reduce the number of nocturia episodes compared to medication (MD ‐0.50, 95% CI ‐0.65 to ‐0.36; 2 studies; 80 participants; I2 = 0%, low‐certainty evidence).

There were no incidences of major adverse events in any of the included studies. However, major adverse events are rare in acupuncture trials and the numbers included in this review may be insufficient to detect these events.

Authors' conclusions
The evidence is very uncertain about the effect acupuncture has on cure or improvement of overactive bladder symptoms compared to no treatment. It is uncertain if there is any difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture in cure or improvement of overactive bladder symptoms. This review provides low‐certainty evidence that acupuncture may result in a slight increase in cure or improvement of overactive bladder symptoms when compared with medication and may reduce the incidence of minor adverse events.

These conclusions must remain tentative until the completion of larger, higher‐quality studies that use relevant, comparable outcomes. Timing and frequency of treatment, point selection, application and long‐term follow‐up are other areas relevant for research.","Acupuncture for treating overactive bladder in adults
Review question

Is acupuncture a safe and effective treatment for treating overactive bladder in adults?

Background

Overactive bladder is the term used to describe a group of urinary symptoms, including an urgent need to pass urine, frequent voiding (emptying), urinary incontinence and waking one or more times at night to pass urine (nocturia). Sufferers may have one or more of these symptoms. Overactive bladder is a common complaint and can affect both men and women of any age, though it is more common in older people. Treatment can include bladder education, pelvic floor exercises, medication, botox injections into the bladder wall, sacral neuromodulation and surgery.

Acupuncture refers to the practice of inserting fine needles into defined points on the body in order to achieve an improvement in health. It is used in a wide range of conditions and has been suggested as a possible treatment for overactive bladder symptoms.

How up‐to‐date is this review?

This review includes all studies that met our eligibility criteria, published up to 14 May 2022. We are aware of six ongoing studies and two studies that we cannot obtain in full, which were not included in our review.

Study characteristics

We included 15 studies involving a total of 1395 participants with overactive bladder. The majority of the studies had small numbers of participants and we had some reservations about the study designs, processes or both in the majority of the studies.

Study funding sources

Of the 15 included studies, four were supported by Chinese Government‐funded research grants and two were funded by Higher Education institutions. The open access publishing fee for one study was paid by the Norwegian Acupuncture Association. Eight studies did not report any source of funding.

Key results

The different methods used by the studies made the comparison of results difficult.

Compared to no treatment, the effect of acupuncture on curing or improving overactive bladder symptoms and the amount of minor side effects is very uncertain. No major adverse events took place. The were no reports on the effect of acupuncture compared to no treatment with regard to reducing urinary urgency, daytime urinary frequency, episodes of urinary incontinence or episodes of nocturia.

Compared to sham (fake) acupuncture, the effect of acupuncture on curing or improving overactive bladder symptoms is uncertain. Acupuncture probably makes little or no difference to the number of minor adverse events compared to sham acupuncture. No major adverse events took place in any of the studies. The evidence is very uncertain regarding the effect of acupuncture on the presence of absence of urinary urgency, daytime urinary frequency or episodes of nocturia. There is probably no difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture in terms of episodes of urinary incontinence.

Acupuncture may result in a slight improvement in overactive bladder symptoms when compared with medication and may result in a reduced number of minor adverse events. No major adverse events took place. The effect of acupuncture compared to medication is very uncertain with regard to urinary urgency and episodes of incontinence. Acupuncture may have the same effect as medication on urinary frequency and may slightly reduce episodes of nocturia.

Certainty of the evidence

The majority of the evidence in this review is of very low or low certainty because the included studies had flaws in their design and/or execution. Many had small numbers of participants and were conducted over a short period of time. Given these issues, it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding how effective acupuncture is for treating overactive bladder. Further well‐designed, large‐scale studies are required to answer this question.
","Title: Acupuncture for treating overactive bladder in adults

Abstract: Abstract Acupuncture is an ancient treatment method used in China for overactive bladder. A systematic review of randomised controlled trials was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of acupuncture for treating overactive bladder in adults. Nine trials met the inclusion criteria. The quality of the trials was generally poor. The trials showed no statistically significant difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture or between acupuncture and conventional treatments. However, there were differences between acupuncture and conventional treatments in some of the trials. Further research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of acupuncture for treating overactive bladder in adults.</s>","# Acupuncture for treating overactive bladder in adults

# Introduction

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a symptom complex of urinary urgency, usually with frequency and nocturia, with or without urge incontinence, in the absence of urinary tract infection or other obvious pathology [[START_REF] An international urogynecological association (IUGA)/international continence society (ICS) joint report on the terminology for female pelvic floor dysfunction, Haylen[END_REF]]. OAB has been reported in 10% of women and 3% of men [[START_REF] Prevalence of overactive bladder and other lower urinary tract symptoms: results of the EPIC study., Irwin[END_REF]]. OAB is associated with significant morbidity, reduced quality of life, and significant healthcare costs [[START_REF] Economic aspects of overactive bladder: the Danish burden of incontinence study (DANBIO), Milsom[END_REF]]. It is a major healthcare problem in many countries.

The current pharmacological treatment of OAB includes antimuscarinic agents, beta-3 adrenoceptor agonists, and alpha-blockers [[START_REF] Clinical guideline for overactive bladder syndrome, Yamaguchi[END_REF]]. In clinical practice, these drugs are used for the treatment of OAB, although their efficacy has been questioned [[START_REF] A randomized trial of the efficacy and tolerability of solifenacin in Japanese patients with overactive bladder: a 12-week, open-label, multicentre study, Inoue[END_REF], [START_REF] Effect of mirabegron on overactive bladder symptoms in Japanese patients: a 12-week, open-label, multicentre study, Kajiwara[END_REF]]. Furthermore, long-term treatment with these drugs is often associated with adverse effects [[START_REF] Effect of antimuscarinic therapy on sexual function in women with overactive bladder: a randomized controlled trial, Cardozo[END_REF], [START_REF] Effect of beta-3 adrenoceptor agonist therapy on male sexual function in patients with overactive bladder: a randomized controlled trial, Cardozo[END_REF]]. Therefore, other therapies are needed to treat OAB.

Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) technique that has been used for treating OAB for more than 2000 years. Acupuncture is used to treat OAB by stimulating specific acupoints [[START_REF] Clinical study on acupuncture for treatment of overactive bladder, Wang[END_REF]]. The acupoints used in acupuncture for treating OAB have been investigated by many clinical trials [[START_REF] Acupuncture for the treatment of overactive bladder: a systematic review and meta-analysis, Lee[END_REF]]. These trials demonstrated that acupuncture is effective for treating OAB, although its efficacy has been questioned [[START_REF] Acupuncture for the treatment of overactive bladder: a systematic review and meta-analysis, Lee[END_REF]].

In this study, we performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for treating OAB in adults.

# Methods

# Data sources and search strategy

We searched for RCTs published before August 2014 that compared acupuncture with other treatments for treating OAB in adults using the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Scientific Journals Database (VIP), Wanfang Database, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM). The search terms were “overactive bladder”, “urinary incontinence”, “acupuncture”, “acupoint”, “acupressure”, and “moxibustion”. The search strategies were adapted for each database.

# Inclusion criteria

The included studies were RCTs that met the following criteria: (1) the study participants were adults with OAB, and (2) the study compared acupuncture with other treatments for treating OAB.

# Exclusion criteria

The excluded studies were (1) non-RCTs, (2) non-clinical studies, (3) duplicate publications, (4) non-English or Chinese studies, and (5) studies with incomplete data.

# Study selection

Two investigators (Q.J. and Y.Y.) independently screened the titles and abstracts of the studies retrieved by the search strategy. If the studies met the inclusion criteria, they were retrieved for full-text assessment. The two investigators (Q.J. and Y.Y.) independently assessed the eligibility of the studies retrieved for full-text assessment and determined the final list of studies included in the systematic review. Disagreements between the two investigators were resolved by discussion or consultation with a third investigator (X.H.).

# Data extraction and quality assessment

Two investigators (Q.J. and Y.Y.) independently extracted the data from the included studies. The data extracted included the first author’s name, publication year, study design, sample size, participant characteristics, intervention, outcome measures, adverse events, and results.

The quality of the included studies was assessed by two investigators (Q.J. and Y.Y.) independently using the Jadad scale [[START_REF] Assessing the quality of reports of randomized clinical trials: is blinding necessary?, Jadad[END_REF]]. The Jadad scale consists of three items: (1) randomization (0–2 points), (2) blinding (0–2 points), and (3) dropouts and withdrawals (0–1 point). A score of 1 or 2 was considered to indicate high quality.

# Data synthesis and analysis

For dichotomous outcomes, the pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. For continuous outcomes, the pooled mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs were calculated. We used the chi-squared test and I[START_SUP]2[END_SUP] statistic to assess the heterogeneity among the included studies. A fixed-effects model was used if the I[START_SUP]2[END_SUP] statistic was less than 50%; otherwise, a random-effects model was used. Publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot. A sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the stability of the results. All analyses were performed using RevMan 5.3 software (The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK).

# Results

# Study selection

We identified 2697 potentially relevant articles, of which 2628 were excluded after the titles and abstracts were screened. We retrieved the full text of the remaining 69 studies, of which 45 were excluded for the following reasons: (1) no RCT design (n = 24), (2) non-clinical study (n = 8), (3) non-acupuncture intervention (n = 6), (4) duplicate publication (n = 3), and (5) no OAB diagnosis (n = 6). Finally, 24 studies [[START_REF] Clinical study on acupuncture for treatment of overactive bladder, Wang[END_REF], [START_REF] Clinical observation on treatment of 60 cases of overactive bladder by electroacupuncture, Wang[END_REF]–[START_REF] Observation on therapeutic effect of electroacupuncture for 30 cases of overactive bladder, Huang[END_REF]] were included in the systematic review. The study selection process is shown in Fig. 1.Fig. 1: Flow diagram of study selection

# Study characteristics

The characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table 1. The 24 studies included a total of 2398 participants, of whom 1245 received acupuncture treatment and 1153 received other treatments. The studies were published between 1998 and 2014. The sample size of the studies ranged from 40 to 240 participants. All of the studies were conducted in China. The mean age of the participants ranged from 42.3 to 65.0 years. The duration of the studies ranged from 4 to 12 weeks. The acupuncture interventions were performed in the form of electroacupuncture (EA), auricular acupuncture (AA), and warm acupuncture (WA). The treatment duration ranged from 15 to 60 min. The other treatments included medication, bladder training, pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), bladder training combined with EA, and PFMT combined with EA.Table 1: Characteristics of the included studies

# Quality assessment

The results of the quality assessment are shown in Table 2. The included studies were randomized, but the methods used to generate the random sequence were not reported in seven studies [[START_REF] Clinical observation on treatment of 60 cases of overactive bladder by electroacupuncture, Wang[END_REF], [START_REF] Clinical observation on the treatment of 40 cases of overactive bladder by electroacupuncture combined with medicine, Zhou[END_REF], [START_REF] Clinical observation on treatment of 60 cases of overactive bladder by electroacupuncture combined with medicine, Wang[END_REF], [START_REF] Clinical observation on treatment of 30 cases of overactive bladder by electroacupuncture combined with medicine, Chen[END_REF], [START_REF] Observation on therapeutic effect of electroacupuncture for 30 cases of overactive bladder, Huang[END_REF], [START_REF] Clinical observation on treatment of 30 cases of overactive bladder by electroacupuncture combined with medicine, Huang[END_REF], [START_REF] Observation on therapeutic effect of electroacupuncture for 30 cases of overactive bladder, Huang[END_REF]].

CD012032.pub3,Reconstructive surgery for treating pressure ulcers,2022,October,13,3,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012032.pub3,Wounds,Wounds,"Background
There are several possible interventions for managing pressure ulcers (sometimes referred to as pressure injuries), ranging from pressure‐relieving measures, such as repositioning, to reconstructive surgery. The surgical approach is usually reserved for recalcitrant wounds (where the healing process has stalled, or the wound is not responding to treatment) or wounds with full‐thickness skin loss and exposure of deeper structures such as muscle fascia or bone. Reconstructive surgery commonly involves wound debridement followed by filling the wound with new tissue. Whilst this is an accepted means of ulcer management, the benefits and harms of different surgical approaches, compared with each other or with non‐surgical treatments, are unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2016.

Objectives
To assess the effects of different types of reconstructive surgery for treating pressure ulcers (category/stage II or above), compared with no surgery or alternative reconstructive surgical approaches, in any care setting.

Search methods
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was January 2022.

Selection criteria
Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed reconstructive surgery in the treatment of pressure ulcers.

Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected the studies, extracted study data, assessed the risk of bias and undertook GRADE assessments. We would have involved a third review author in case of disagreement.

Main results
We identified one RCT conducted in a hospital setting in the USA. It enrolled 20 participants aged between 20 and 70 years with stage IV ischial or sacral pressure ulcers (involving full‐thickness skin and tissue loss). The study compared two reconstructive techniques for stage IV pressure ulcers: conventional flap surgery and cone of pressure flap surgery, in which a large portion of the flap tip is de‐epithelialised and deeply inset to obliterate dead space. There were no clear data for any of our outcomes, although we extracted some information on complete wound healing, wound dehiscence, pressure ulcer recurrence and wound infection. We graded the evidence for these outcomes as very low‐certainty. The study provided no data for any other outcomes.

Authors' conclusions
Currently there is very little randomised evidence on the role of reconstructive surgery in pressure ulcer management, although it is considered a priority area. More rigorous and robust research is needed to explore this intervention.","What are the benefits and risks of reconstructive surgery for treating pressure ulcers?
Key messages

‐ We are uncertain about the benefits and risks of reconstructive surgery (sometimes known as plastic surgery) for treating pressure ulcers (sometimes known as bedsores, pressure sores or pressure injuries). 

‐ We found one small study (20 participants) that investigated reconstructive surgery in deep, hard‐to‐heal pressure ulcers, but we were unable to reach any conclusions from the reported results.

‐ Larger, well‐designed studies are needed to explore this priority area.

What are pressure ulcers?

Pressure ulcers are skin and tissue injuries that are usually caused by people staying in the same position for long periods of time. When external pressure is constantly applied to parts of the body, blood flow is restricted to the skin and underlying tissues. This can cause the skin or underlying tissue to break down, especially in areas that have less fat such as the lower back and heel.

People at risk of developing pressure ulcers include older adults, people with mobility problems (e.g. wheelchair users) and people who spend long periods in hospital.

How are pressure ulcers treated?

Pressure ulcers are serious wounds that are costly to treat, so care is mainly focused on preventing them. When ulcers do occur, treatment options include wound dressings, antibiotics and antiseptics.

Reconstructive surgery is usually reserved for deep or hard‐to‐heal pressure ulcers. There are different types of reconstructive surgery, but most involve removing dead tissue from the wound then using soft tissue such as muscle, fat or skin from other parts of the person's body to fill the wound cavity.

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to assess the benefits and risks of reconstructive surgery for treating pressure ulcers compared with no surgery; and the benefits and risks of different types of reconstructive surgery compared with each other. The results we were interested in were:

‐ complete wound healing;
‐ wounds reopening or new ulcers occurring at the same site as previous ulcers;
‐ resource use and costs;
‐ health‐related quality of life;
‐ wound infection; and
‐ new ulcers occurring at different sites from previous ulcers. 

What did we do? 

We searched electronic databases and trials registers for randomised controlled trials, which are clinical studies that randomly allocate participants to different treatment groups. This type of study design can provide the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. We included studies that investigated the effects of reconstructive surgery for treating pressure ulcers compared with no surgery. We also included studies that compared different types of reconstructive surgery for treating pressure ulcers. We applied no restrictions on language, date of publication, or where the study was conducted. We rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and the number of people included. 

What did we find? 

We found one small study, which was carried out in the USA and recruited 20 participants in hospital. This study investigated two different reconstructive surgical techniques for treating stage IV pressure ulcers, which have full‐thickness skin and tissue loss. The study did not provide enough information on wound healing, wound reopening, ulcer recurrence or wound infection for us to judge the effectiveness of the different surgical techniques.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

We are uncertain what effect the two surgical techniques had on wound healing, reopening or recurrence, because the trial was not well conducted or reported, and it included a small number of participants. 

We are uncertain about the benefits and harms of reconstructive surgery, and of different surgical techniques, for treating pressure ulcers. More rigorous research is needed in this area, as patients, carers and health professionals consider it a priority issue.

How up to date is this evidence?

This is an update of a previous review. The evidence is up to date to January 2022.","Title: Reconstructive surgery for treating pressure ulcers

# Flap surgery

A study was conducted on 120 patients with PUs, who were randomly divided into two groups. The first group was treated with flap surgery, and the second group was treated with traditional methods. After treatment, the clinical efficacy was evaluated.
