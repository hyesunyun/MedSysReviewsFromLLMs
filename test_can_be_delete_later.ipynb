       "\"Title: Antipsychotic dose reduction compared to dose continuation for people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder: systematic review and meta-analysis.* The main findings are (i) that antipsychotic doses were reduced by an average of 38.3%, (ii) that there were no improvements in functional capacity and quality of life, (iii) that there were small improvements in social functioning, and (iv) that there were small improvements in psychological outcomes during the 3 months after reductions but after the longer term differences were very small and not significant compared to continued dose continuation.\\n\\nWaiting times of 10 years or more between the development of an effective drug and its approval are not new. The failure of new drugs to reach their potential cost benefits in the short term, coupled with lack of knowledge about the long term implications and the availability of a range of treatment options, is of concern.^[@CIT0001]^ New drugs for schizophrenia are developed at a rate of 5--10 per year, which leaves them less than four years to gain market share compared to other drugs.^[@CIT0001]^ Despite a lack of evidence on the long term outcomes of reducing the antipsychotic dose, patients with mild-moderate symptoms are often prescribed lower doses of antipsychotic medications. Around 30% of patients receiving a second-generation antipsychotic are not prescribed their maximum maintenance dose, which is commonly defined as the dose that produces an acute symptomatic improvement.^[@CIT0002]^\\n\\nThe aim of the trial was to determine whether a reduction or increase in antipsychotic doses for people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder results in less need for inpatient treatment and/or lower treatment costs in the medium term. The question also addressed: what is the impact of having a reduced dose on (i) symptoms during the 3 months after the reduction and (ii) symptoms and functioning at 12 months after dose reduction, (iii) quality of life during the 3 months after the reduction and (iv) quality of life at 12 months after dose reduction, and (v) costs during hospitalization and the 3 months after the reduction. (vi) What are the differences between patients and service users, (vii) what is the level of satisfaction with treatment and (viii) what is the cost of reducing versus not reducing the dose.\\n\\nThe review has been written using the PRISMA statement^[@CIT0003]^ and the Cochrane Handbook for systematic reviews^[@CIT0004]^ which provides guidelines for the conduct, documentation, and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analysis of randomized trials.\\n\\nMethods {#s2}\\n=======\\n\\nInformation sources and literature searches {#s3}\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\nStudies were identified from computer-aided searches of MEDLINE (1966 to July 2007) and EMBASE (1988 to July 2007) using EMBASE and MEDLINE\\\\'s MEDLINE In-Process Citations and PsycINFO search functions to identify unpublished studies, and from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2007), EMBASE (1988 to July 2007), and PsycINFO (1806 to July, 2007).

The new technique utilizes high-intensity ultrasound to disrupt cell membranes. While conventional sonication (US) typically induces significant cell damage, higher ultrasound intensities produce a change in cell permeability rather than cell death. Using a variety of US exposure times and intensities, a model experiment was designed that compared the effectiveness of these two techniques to release a model compound from the cells. The model compound, trans-resveratrol, was first absorbed into an active charcoal slurry to minimize its interference with other compounds extracted from plant cells. The results of the model experiments indicated that high-intensity US was more effective than low-intensity US in enhancing cell permeability. High-intensity US resulted in greater than 95% extraction efficiencies for trans-resveratrol in as little as 3 min of treatment. These results suggested that high-intensity US might be a promising technique for facilitating the extraction of target compounds from plants prior to LCMS analysis.Extra-oral craniofacial fibrous dysplasia--recurring lesions, surgical management, and follow-up.\\nThe presentation of 2 cases of fibrous dysplasia of the mandible is reported. One lesion recurred after 3 years and was removed again after a further 3 years. The other lesion did not recur, indicating that it was not neoplastic. Surgical interventions carried out and follow-up treatment for each patient are discussed. The need for continued investigation of the various forms of treatment is emphasised.[The first case of human parechovirus type 3 in Colombia].\\nHuman parechovirus type 3 has been described recently as a pathogenic virus in newborn infants. It has not been described as a cause of illness in pediatric patients from Colombia. We present the first case of parechovirus isolated in Colombia in a child with febrile syndrome and diarrhea. We describe the first parechovirus isolation to describe genotype 3 in Colombia. We propose to detect this agent in stool samples from children'"

       "'Title: Rapid, point-of-care antigen tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection\\n\\nAbstract: Introduction: In the absence of an effective treatment for COVID-19, early diagnosis and isolation of patients are the most effective ways to control the spread of the virus. The current gold standard for diagnosis of COVID-19 is real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, the high cost and long turnaround time of RT-PCR tests limit their use in low- and middle-income countries. In addition, RT-PCR is not suitable for point-of-care testing and requires trained personnel. In this review, we will focus on the development of rapid, point-of-care antigen tests that can be used in low- and middle-income countries to diagnose COVID-19. Methods: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant studies published between December 2019 and May 2020. We included studies that compared the sensitivity and specificity of antigen tests with those of RT-PCR tests. Results: The results of 11 studies that compared the sensitivity and specificity of antigen tests with those of RT-PCR tests are summarized in Table 1. The sensitivity and specificity of antigen tests varied widely between studies, with some tests showing very low sensitivity (55%) and specificity (66%). Conclusions: Antigen tests have the potential to be used in point-of-care settings to diagnose COVID-19. However, further studies are required to compare the performance of antigen tests with that of RT-PCR tests and to establish their clinical utility.</s>'"

It focuses mainly on three actions concerning the participation of both general population and patients: information, prevention, and early diagnosis. As of May 2018, it has been implemented in about 7 million people and in almost 25 million smokers, including 22.3 million people under 40 years. The campaign, involving over 420,000 organizations, reached 9 million audiences (1.5%) and is a major source for cancer information and awareness (about 85%). The impact of the campaign is demonstrated by an increase in the demand for tobacco-use cessation and by a decrease of around 3% in smoking in France in 2017. In 2017, the FNLCC launched a pilot screening with the Fecal Occult Blood Test program, which is now in phase III. According to the preliminary analysis of the first years of operation, the screening program has achieved a participation rate of more than 5% in 2017 and of 8% in the first 6 months of 2018. In addition, the program led to an increase of about 3% in the detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases, and a decrease in the median tumor size for CRC from 3.5 cm to 2 cm at diagnosis. These data confirm that the FNLCC campaign has contributed to an increase in awareness and an early diagnosis of CRC among screening participants. The objective of the \"Give us a chance!\" Campaign is now under revision in order to improve the screening program.Clinical trials for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington disease: a European perspective.\\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized mainly by the loss of both upper and lower motor neurons. This devastating disease remains incurable and is uniformly fatal within 3 years of diagnosis. There is currently no treatment available for this devastating disease; although several molecules are under investigation for the symptomatic treatment of different complications. At present, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cannot be treated or cured with neuroprotective agents. Huntington disease is a devastating genetic illness characterized by an expansion of polyglutamine stretches in the protein huntingtin. At present, the only effective therapeutic strategy for Huntington disease is to delay the onset of disease by interfering with the abnormal expansion of the polyglutamine sequence. To date, several attempts have been carried out in order to develop neuroprotective and disease-modifying drugs for these two neurodegenerative diseases, with various degrees of success. In this review, we summarize the current clinical trials on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington disease in Europe.Toxicokinetics and metabolism of N-butyl benzenesulfonyl aziridines in rats.\\nN-Methyl, N-benzyl, N-butyl and N-succinyl analogs were administered to male Fischer 344 rats, and blood, urine, feces and bile were analyzed for parent drug and metabolites. After dosing (7.5 mmol/kg body weight, i.v.), the N-butyl compounds were extensively distributed into tissues and were eliminated slowly (t 1/2 greater than 96 h). The N-succinyl analog had a lower clearance than the other benzenesulfonyl aziridines, which was probably due to increased protein binding. These compounds were excreted through the kidneys as a function of both dose and time, and metabolism in the liver was minimal. The N-benzyl analog'"

       "'Title: Quarantine alone or in combination with other public health measures to control COVID-19: a rapid review\\n\\nAbstract: Background: COVID-19 has been a global pandemic. Quarantine has been a public health measure used to control the spread of COVID-19. The aim of this review was to summarize the evidence on the effectiveness of quarantine in preventing and controlling the spread of COVID-19. Methods: A rapid review of peer-reviewed studies on the effectiveness of quarantine alone or in combination with other public health measures to control COVID-19 was conducted. Articles were identified by searching the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases for studies published between January 1, 2020 and March 31, 2020. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist. The strength of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results: The search strategy identified 1422 articles, of which 31 met the inclusion criteria. The included studies were conducted in China, Italy, Singapore, Hong Kong, and the USA. All studies were observational and reported on quarantine alone. Quarantine was associated with lower incidence of COVID-19 and lower mortality in some studies, but the quality of evidence was very low. Quarantine was not associated with significant differences in incidence of COVID-19 or mortality in the studies that used a control group. Quarantine was associated with a higher proportion of COVID-19 cases who had a mild illness, but the quality of evidence was very low. Conclusions: Quarantine alone is unlikely to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 or mortality. However, quarantine may help reduce the proportion of COVID-19 cases with a mild illness.</s>'"

Wistar male rats fed with a commercial or high fat diet were divided into three groups randomly. The high fat diet increased the ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids in two groups, from 1:2.2 to 3:1 and the commercial diet of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids was 1:10. After 8 weeks feeding, plasma lipids, myocardial energy metabolism and myocardial function were measured. The myocardial fatty acid composition was analyzed. There were significantly high plasma total cholesterol, tri-glyceride in the rats fed with a high fat diet compared with the group fed with the commercial diet (P < 0.05-0.01), and the high fat diet mainly resulted in high plasma total cholesterol levels. The myocardial function was decreased, and the myocardial metabolism in rats fed with a high fat diet was significantly different in the two groups with regards to myocardial glycogen and fatty acids. High fat diet increased the ratio of n-6 to n-3, and the n-3 fatty acids may increase the myocardial metabolism, and high plasma total cholesterol level may accelerate atherosclerosis.1..

Etiopathogenesis of refractory CRSwNP remains poorly understood.

We included 12 trials involving 11,356 participants in the review. In most trials, the DAs were used by people who had been diagnosed with a serious illness or by people who were considering screening for a serious condition. The results of our review suggest that DAs may help people to consider the benefits and harms of health treatments or screening tests more clearly, but they do not appear to increase the proportion of people who decide to have the treatment or screening. DAs may increase the number of people who know what to do, but they do not appear to affect people’s behaviour.

A systematic review and meta-analysis. Medline, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched between 2006 and 2015 with no lower date limit applied. Studies investigating the efficacy of DA in the promotion of informed choice in health interventions were included. Fifty-eight studies reporting on 45 different DA on 33 health topics were included. Only 9 of these interventions showed evidence of having a positive impact on the decision quality for people with low literacy levels. The most widely used DA were the Ottawa Decision Support Framework (6%) and the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (6%). Some significant but clinically modest levels of difference in the outcomes of anxiety, informed decision, knowledge and satisfaction of decision were seen with different DA interventions. The meta-analyses show no statistically significant benefit for DA in the overall outcomes with small differences between DA versus usual care (for anxiety, p=0.558; for knowledge, p=0.532; for satisfaction, p=0.701). In fact the DA group was less confident than the control group (p=0.000) about their decisions being the best ones possible. Despite the potential benefits for people making decisions about their health, the adoption of these interventions has been slow in Western countries. The widespread use of DA in healthcare is limited by our modest understanding of their efficacy and effectiveness, which in turn is related to the fact that they are largely untested, poorly designed and do not reflect values that are important to people. Given the growing interest from the international community in DA, to be supported by governments and health services in their evaluation and implementation, further research is needed for a better understanding of the factors that affect their use and outcome. The use of DA in the health field will require changes in the culture and values of professionals and consumers. We found only weak evidence about the beneficial effect of DA, and small differences between those who use them and those who do not.Background {#Sec1}\\n==========\\n\\nPancreatic cancer is the 4th leading cause of cancer-related mortality (696,000 deaths) and fifth most common cancer diagnosed (469,000 cases) worldwide \\\\[[@CR1]\\\\]. Early-stage pancreatic cancer is asymptomatic, thus is usually not amenable for intervention. At later stages, symptoms are related to primary tumor location and secondary sites of metastasis \\\\[[@CR2]\\\\]; whereas the symptoms related to distant metastasis of pancreatic cancer are generally present within the liver, lung, bone and brain, especially the liver \\\\[[@CR3]\\\\].\\n\\nThe metastasis of pancreatic cancer is a very complicated process, involving multiple steps. It has been shown that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a crucial role in the invasion and metastasis of tumors \\\\[[@CR4]\\\\], and the occurrence of EMT is correlated with the ability of invasion and metastasis of liver metastasis cells \\\\[[@CR5], [@CR6]\\\\]. The key to reversing EMT is regulating transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and its receptor \\\\[[@CR7]\\\\]. During EMT, tumor cells lose their epithelial cell morphology and cell polarity. Subsequently, they lose the expression of E-cadherin, a cell adhesion molecule. Up-regulated transcription factors such as Snail and Slug are also associated with the loss of cell polarity \\\\[[@CR8]\\\\]. After invasion and metastasis of tumor cells, they undergo reverse EMT and obtain the characteristic of epithelial cells \\\\[[@CR9]\\\\]. These findings suggest that reverse EMT has an important effect on the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells.\\n\\nRecently, many molecular targeted drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have been applied to clinical therapy of malignant tumors \\\\[[@CR10], [@CR11]\\\\]. Sorafenib, a small molecule protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, can block the activation of VEGFR, PDGFR, and Raf-1, leading to inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation \\\\[[@CR12]\\\\]. Moreover, it can also inhibit invasion and reverse EMT in lung adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma \\\\[[@CR13], [@CR14]\\\\].

       "'Title: Physician advice for smoking cessation\\n\\nAbstract: The benefits of smoking cessation are well known. The role of physician advice in assisting smokers to quit has been controversial. This review considers the evidence for and against the efficacy of physician advice to quit. There is strong evidence that brief advice from a physician is effective in helping people to stop smoking. In a number of studies, physician advice increased the proportion of smokers who quit compared with a control group. In the most recent study of physician advice, the proportion of people who quit was double in the group that received brief advice from a physician compared with a control group. The increase in quitting rates is of the same order of magnitude as the increase in quitting rates following the provision of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). In the UK, where smoking is a serious public health problem, a new initiative has been introduced to increase the provision of physician advice. The National Health Service (NHS) has committed to providing all smokers with free nicotine patches and a free consultation with a smoking cessation advisor. It is anticipated that this initiative will increase the proportion of smokers who will receive advice to quit. However, it is likely that many smokers will receive NRT in the form of patches rather than physician advice. There is a need for further research to determine the relative effectiveness of these two interventions.</s>'"

To determine whether this reduced spontaneous activity was related to the nutritional status of the animals, protein-restricted rats were fed ad libitum, pair fed with a CP group or undernourished to match body weight (BW) and lean body mass (LBM) of CP rats. After 7 days of feeding, pair feeding resulted in a significant increase in the activity level. When pair fed with the CP group, LP rats consumed significantly less food, so they were less likely to be undernourished. In contrast, during feeding ad libitum and when fed ad libitum, both LP and CP rats achieved very different compositions and BWs. LP rats showed significantly lower BW, carcass protein and LBM and a greater degree of hypophagia. After 3 weeks of LP feeding, the BW and composition of the remaining CP rats were significantly worse than the LP rats. The LP rats were in positive energy balance, whereas the CP rats lost BW, carcass protein and LBM. Although during the first 48 h of feeding ad libitum they were hyperphagic, after 1 week of LP feeding they became hypophagic. At the beginning of the feeding period LP rats showed an impaired glucose tolerance, but after 3 weeks of ad libitum feeding they showed a complete restoration of glucose tolerance and even an improvement in the insulin response to intraperitoneal glucose.

       "'Title: Nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation. Introduction {#Sec1}\\n=============\\n\\nTinnitus is defined as a perception of sound in the absence of external auditory stimulation^[@CR1]^. More than one third of the world\\'s population is affected by various degrees of tinnitus, of whom less than 2% have severe tinnitus and are unable to bear the associated distress^[@CR2]^. The burden of tinnitus on patients and society is significant and is associated with decreased quality of life, impaired sleep quality, and higher rates of anxiety and depression, among other factors^[@CR3]--[@CR5]^. There is currently no consensus with regard to recommended treatment for tinnitus^[@CR6]^. Although some patients experience marked improvement with initial treatment of tinnitus, many experience recurrence in many weeks to months following treatment^[@CR6]^.\\n\\nNicotine replacement is common treatment for tobacco dependence. In many countries, nicotine replacement products are widely available over-the-counter as cessation aids. Given the high prevalence of tobacco use, however, nicotine replacement has also been used to treat tinnitus. Two decades ago, the first study exploring the effects of nicotine replacement to treat tinnitus was reported among patients undergoing clinical tobacco cessation^[@CR7]^. In this pilot study of 16 smokers, nicotine replacement therapy was shown to produce significant improvements in tinnitus loudness, frequency, and distress. Subsequently, several other small uncontrolled trials have reported benefits of nicotine replacement therapy for tinnitus symptoms^[@CR8]--[@CR11]^. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reviewed these studies together^[@CR12]--[@CR14]^. The most recent meta-analysis^[@CR14]^ included 10 studies published prior to July 2014 and included a total of 257 participants. In this most recent meta-analysis, the authors concluded that there were significant reductions in tinnitus distress for patients using nicotine replacement therapy compared to placebo^[@CR14]^. However, they included studies published before 2010 in the overall analysis^[@CR15]--[@CR19]^. Also, this most recent meta-analysis did not assess changes in tinnitus loudness.\\n\\nThe purpose of the present meta-analysis was to update the previous meta-analysis investigating the efficacy of nicotine replacement therapy for tinnitus severity and to assess changes in tinnitus loudness. The main question is whether nicotine replacement treatment has significant benefits for tinnitus-related distress and loudness. A secondary outcome was also included to assess the effects of nicotine replacement therapy on tinnitus quality.\\n\\nBased on these results, we also sought to determine the number of participants needed to treat for both tinnitus severity and tinnitus loudness.\\n\\nResults {#Sec2}\\n=======\\n\\nCharacteristics of included studies {#Sec3}\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nA flowchart of the literature search and selection is presented in Fig.\\xa0[1](#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}. The database search for the present meta-analysis and systematic review revealed 1,430 publications (1,373 articles after removal of duplicates). After initial screening of abstracts, 43 articles were selected for full-text screening. An additional 31 articles were excluded from the meta-analysis (16 articles did not assess efficacy of nicotine replacement on tinnitus, 11 articles did not use an objective outcome measure, 4 articles did not use a randomized controlled design, and 10 were duplicate reports). Twelve articles (five randomized controlled trials and seven prospective randomized crossover trials) were included in the meta-analysis^[@CR7],[@CR8],[@CR10]--[@CR12],[@CR20]--[@CR27]^. The two authors discussed all controversial articles, and an agreement regarding inclusion or exclusion of the article was achieved in all cases. The literature search and selection also yielded five previously published systematic reviews with meta-analyses that assessed the effect of nicotine replacement therapy on various aspects of tinnitus (Table\\xa0[1](#Tab1){ref-type=\"table\"})^[@CR14],[@CR28]--[@CR31]^.Figure 1Flow diagram of literature search and selection.Table 1Previous systematic reviews.Reviews (author, year, country, journal)Search time frameSearch terms (database)Search numbersIncluded in meta-analysisIncluded studiesIncluded RCTsMethodological quality (NOS)Grimm (1996), Australia, Ear Nose Throat J^[@CR28]^January 1994 to August 1996Medical Subject Headings (MEDLINE)Tinnitus and (nicotine or cotinine or nicotine replacement therapy'"
