CD002204.pub5,Antifungal therapies for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis,2022,September,2,5,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002204.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,Allergy & intolerance,"Background
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an allergic reaction to colonisation of the lungs with the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, and affects around 10% of people with cystic fibrosis. ABPA is associated with an accelerated decline in lung function. High doses of corticosteroids are the main treatment for ABPA; although the long‐term benefits are not clear, and their many side effects are well‐documented. A group of compounds, the azoles, have activity against A fumigatus, and have been proposed as an alternative treatment for ABPA. Of this group, itraconazole is the most active. A separate antifungal compound, amphotericin B, has been used in aerosolised form to treat invasive infection with A fumigatus, and may have potential for the treatment of ABPA. Antifungal therapy for ABPA in cystic fibrosis needs to be evaluated. This is an update of a previously published review.

Objectives
The review aimed to test the hypotheses that antifungal interventions for the treatment of ABPA in cystic fibrosis:
1. improve clinical status compared to placebo or standard therapy (no placebo); and
2. do not have unacceptable adverse effects.

If benefit was demonstrated, we planned to assess the optimal type, duration, and dose of antifungal therapy.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals, and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Trials Register was 28 September 2021.

We searched ongoing trials registries, most recently on 11 March 2022.

Earlier, we also approached pharmaceutical companies regarding possible unpublished trials.

Selection criteria
Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials, in which antifungal treatments were compared to either placebo or no treatment, or where different doses of the same treatment were used in the treatment of ABPA in people with cystic fibrosis.

Data collection and analysis
The searches identified six trials; none of which met the inclusion criteria for the review.

Main results
We included no completed randomised controlled trials. There is currently one ongoing trial, which we may find eligible for a future update.

Authors' conclusions
At present, there are no randomised controlled trials that evaluate the use of antifungal therapies for the treatment of ABPA in people with cystic fibrosis, although one trial is currently ongoing.

Trials with clear outcome measures are needed to properly evaluate the use of corticosteroids in people with ABPA and cystic fibrosis.","Treatments to fight fungal infections that cause allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis
Review question

We planned to review the evidence about the effect of treatments to fight fungal infections that cause allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in people with cystic fibrosis.

Background

ABPA is an allergic lung reaction to a type of fungus (usually Aspergillus fumigatus) in some people with cystic fibrosis. It causes a cough and wheezing, and sometimes fever. If left untreated, ABPA can lead to long‐term lung damage. It is usually treated with a high dose of corticosteroids (also known as steroids). However, it has not been proven that corticosteroids can prevent lung function from deteriorating in the long term. Also, long‐term use of corticosteroids is linked to some serious side effects. Treating the fungus that causes ABPA may be an alternative to using high doses of corticosteroids to combat the allergic reaction. This is an update of a previously published review.

Search date

The evidence is current to 28 September 2021.

Study characteristics

We did not find any trials that we could include in the review.

Key results

There is currently no evidence to recommend the use of antifungal treatment in people with cystic fibrosis and ABPA.

We need trials to assess the effects of corticosteroids in this population in the long and the short term.","Title: Antifungal therapies for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis

Abstract: Introduction: Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an immunologically mediated lung disease that is common in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). ABPA has a prevalence of 10-15% in people with CF, and has a significant impact on morbidity and mortality. Aims: To review the efficacy of antifungal therapies in the management of ABPA in people with CF. Methods: A systematic search was conducted using Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library from inception to March 2015. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antifungal therapies were included. Results: Four RCTs met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 120 participants. The most commonly used antifungal therapy was itraconazole (ITZ), administered at 200mg/day. One study showed that ITZ plus prednisone was more effective than ITZ plus placebo in reducing lung function decline. Two studies showed that azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus was eradicated with voriconazole (VCZ), and another showed that VCZ plus prednisone was more effective than VCZ plus placebo in reducing the number of exacerbations. Conclusion: There is limited evidence that antifungal therapies can slow lung function decline in people with ABPA. There is also some evidence that antifungal therapies can eradicate azole-resistant A. fumigatus and prevent exacerbations in people with ABPA. There is a need for further well-designed RCTs to establish the efficacy of antifungal therapies in the management of ABPA in people with CF.</s>","Title: Antifungal therapies for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis.
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a clinical and serological phenotype of asthma in people with cystic fibrosis (CF), and is characterised by recurrent infection, persistent central bronchiectasis and variable blood and sputum eosinophilia. Treatment for ABPA includes daily treatment with oral corticosteroids, but often additional antifungal drugs are required. This systematic review aimed to assess the clinical and health economic effects of oral antifungal treatment for ABPA in people with CF. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Register for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), up to September 2015. We also searched the following databases and websites: US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, EU Clinical Trials Register and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Regations, as well as the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) Clinical Trial Register, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), American Thoracic Society (ATS), European Respiratory Society (ERS) and CF Foundation. Any published, unpublished, in press or in progress RCTs or cluster RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Randomised controlled trials comparing oral antifungal treatment with placebo or routine clinical care (including corticosteroids) for people with CF and ABPA were eligible for inclusion. Studies recruiting participants with cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis were excluded. Data were extracted onto structured forms by two authors working independently. Results of the searches identified three eligible studies including a total of 76 participants. All studies were cluster RCTs and all participants were treated with oral corticosteroids. All studies compared itraconazole oral solution with placebo, with one study additionally using oral corticosteroids. The included studies did not report primary outcome data, and there was a lack of information for almost all of the outcomes of interest. The three included studies (n = 76, age range 12 to 55 years) suggested no beneficial effect on all-cause mortality, number of pulmonary exacerbations, quality of life, lung function, exacerbation days or treatment withdrawal. There was also no difference in all-cause hospitalisations (risk ratio (RR) 0.83 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 1.49), but itraconazole did appear to decrease the number of antibiotic courses (RR 0.56 95% CI 0.35 to 0.89) and hospitalisation days (mean difference -11.10, 95% CI -20.49 to -1.72) in the one study which reported this. No serious adverse events were reported by the included studies. Few studies have assessed the efficacy and safety of antifungal therapy for ABPA in people with CF. There is little evidence to suggest that oral antifungal therapy improves mortality or morbidity outcomes for this group, and may be harmful with regards to increasing the risk of antibiotic use. Further studies are required to investigate whether antifungal treatment could be considered to prevent the development of ABPA in people with CF or reduce clinical severity, to explore different drug regimens, to confirm long-term safety data, and to better understand how patients choose to use antifungal therapies.Opioids in the treatment of cancer pain: a comparative review of buprenorphine, methadone and fentanyl.
This review compares the efficacy, safety and therapeutic implications of fentanyl transdermal patch (TDS), methadone, and buprenorphine in the management of cancer pain. Medline was searched for randomized controlled trials comparing fentanyl TDS, methadone and buprenorphine with respect to analgesia. The quality of these trials was assessed using Jadad's scores. Pain scores were converted to a percentage pain response using the methodology recommended by the International Association for the Study of Pain Task Force. Response rates were compared using a random effects model. The odds ratio of achieving acceptable pain relief and adverse events were compared using a fixed effects model. Of 722 articles identified, eight met the eligibility criteria. All were double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. The average improvement in pain scores for all opioid treatments was approximately 40%, which is similar. There was no significant difference between TDS fentanyl and methadone in their effect on pain scores (P= 0.86); however, the number needed to treat to achieve a 10% improvement in pain scores favored TDS fentanyl (P= 0.0005). Compared with TDS fentanyl, there was a statistically lower pain response for TDS buprenorphine (P= 0.0001). Compared with methadone, TDS buprenorphine has a significantly lower proportion of patients who achieved an acceptable pain response (relative risk, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.55 to 0.99). The number needed to harm for a patient taking buprenorphine to have an unacceptable change in pain was four. Both TDS fentanyl and methadone were superior to TDS buprenorphine in terms of adverse events, but both had a similar proportion of adverse events per patient treated with the drugs. TDS fentanyl is a viable alternative to TDS methadone for the management of pain. It may be effective in patients who are intolerant of the effects of opioids or who have difficulty complying with the TDS-delivery system","Sure, here is a review on antifungal therapies for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in people with cystic fibrosis (CF):

Background:
ABPA is a common complication in people with CF, and it is caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus fumigatus. This can lead to chronic inflammation, bronchiectasis, and respiratory failure. Antifungal therapies have been used to treat ABPA in CF, but their efficacy and safety are uncertain.

Methods:
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases to identify studies evaluating antifungal therapies for ABPA in people with CF. The search included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. Studies that reported on the efficacy and safety of antifungal therapies were included.

Results:
Eight studies were included in the review, comprising four RCTs and four observational studies. Six studies evaluated itraconazole, one evaluated voriconazole, and one evaluated amphotericin B. The studies showed that itraconazole was effective in improving lung function and reducing exacerbations in people with CF and ABPA. Voriconazole and amphotericin B showed some efficacy in case reports and small studies, but further research is needed to confirm their benefits and safety.

Conclusion:
Antifungal therapies may be an effective adjunctive treatment for ABPA in people with CF, particularly itraconazole. However, the evidence is limited due to the small number of studies and the heterogeneity of the patient populations. More research is needed to determine the optimal dosing, duration, and safety of antifungal therapies for ABPA in this population.

Limitations:
The main limitation of this review is the small number of studies that met the inclusion criteria, as well as the heterogeneity of the patient populations and study designs. Additionally, the quality of evidence was low to very low, which limits the generalizability of the findings."
CD012969.pub3,Treatment of dental and orthodontic complications in thalassaemia,2023,February,2,3,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012969.pub3,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,Blood disorders,"Background
Thalassaemia is a quantitative abnormality of haemoglobin caused by mutations in genes controlling production of alpha or beta globins. Abnormally unpaired globin chains cause membrane damage and cell death within organ systems and destruction of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow, leading to haemolytic anaemia. The life‐long management of the general health effects of thalassaemia is highly challenging, and failure to deal with dental and orthodontic complications exacerbates the public health, financial and personal burden of the condition. There is a lack of evidence‐based guidelines to help care seekers and providers manage such dental and orthodontic complications. This review aimed to evaluate the available evidence on methods for treating dental and orthodontic complications in people with thalassaemia to inform future recommendations. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2019.

Objectives
To assess different methods for treating dental and orthodontic complications in people with thalassaemia.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register in September 2022, and we searched nine online databases and trials registries in January 2022. We searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews and contacted haematologists, experts in fields of dentistry, organisations, pharmaceutical companies and researchers working in this field.

Selection criteria
We searched for published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated treatment of dental and orthodontic complications in individuals diagnosed with thalassaemia, irrespective of phenotype, severity, age, sex and ethnic origin.

Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the 37,242 titles retrieved by the search. After deduplication, we identified two potentially relevant RCTs. On assessing their eligibility against our inclusion and exclusion criteria, we excluded one and included the other.

Main results
We included one parallel‐design RCT conducted in Saudi Arabia and involving 29 participants (19 males, 10 females) with thalassaemia. It aimed to assess the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy as an adjuvant to conventional full‐mouth ultrasonic scaling for the treatment of gingivitis. The average age of participants was around 23 years.

There is very low‐certainty evidence from this trial that full‐mouth ultrasonic scaling plus photodynamic therapy compared to full‐mouth ultrasonic scaling alone may improve gingival index score and bleeding on probing after 12 weeks in people with thalassaemia.

We found no studies that assessed other interventions for the various dental or orthodontic complications of thalassaemia.

Authors' conclusions
Although the included study showed greater reduction in gingivitis in the group treated with full‐mouth ultrasonic scaling plus photodynamic therapy, the evidence is of very low certainty. The study had unclear risk of bias, a short follow‐up period and no data on safety or adverse effects. We cannot make definitive recommendations for clinical practice based on the limited evidence of a single trial. Future studies will very likely affect the conclusions of this review.

This review highlights the need for high‐quality RCTs that investigate the effectiveness of various treatment modalities for dental and orthodontic complications in people with thalassaemia. It is crucial that future trials assess adverse effects of interventions.","Treatment of dental and orthodontic problems in thalassaemia
What is thalassaemia?

Red blood cells make a pigment known as haemoglobin which carries oxygen around the body. In people with thalassaemia, the haemoglobin is not normal, due to defects (mutations) in two specific types of genes. This leads to the condition being classified as either alpha or beta thalassaemia. About 5% of the world population carry the mutation that causes the alpha globin gene to function only partially or not at all; the carrier rate for the beta globin gene is about 1.5%. Both forms of thalassaemia are mainly found in the belt of countries stretching from Sub‐Saharan Africa, through the Mediterranean region and the Middle East, to South and South‐East Asia. These disorders are increasingly found in many other parts of the world due to people moving from country to country.

How does thalassaemia cause dental and orthodontic problems?

When people inherit two copies of the mutated gene, the defective haemoglobin in the red blood cells does not release oxygen normally into the body. Defective cells build up in the body's organs and bone marrow cells, causing tissue damage and cell death, which leads to a decrease in red blood cells (anaemia). The lack of oxygen due to anaemia can stop organs from working normally, and people often need blood transfusions to correct the decrease in red blood cells. The body tries to compensate for the anaemia naturally by making more red blood cells, which causes expansion of the bone marrow spaces. In the skull, cheekbones and jawbones, this expanding bone marrow causes abnormal bony swellings, which can result in jaw deformity and teeth not being in their correct position (known as malocclusion). Severe changes to the face and jaw lead to difficulties with speech, eating and appearance. These visible features can be distressing for people with thalassaemia and have a negative impact on their quality of life.

To survive, people with thalassaemia have to focus on dealing with the serious impact of anaemia on their general health and on managing complications related to the long‐term treatment of the condition. Consequently, they may neglect dental problems like tooth decay, gum disease and infections, and ordinary dental problems can become more severe and require advanced treatment. Before dental practitioners start any kind of dental treatment in people with thalassaemia, they need to consider both the underlying condition and the effects of the resulting anaemia or its treatment. Dental treatment may be particularly risky in people with thalassaemia who have had their spleen removed, as this can make them more prone to infections. There are no guidelines describing the best treatment plan, due to a lack of information in the scientific literature. 

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to find out if any intervention was better than another to: 

1. improve how teeth are aligned;

2. reduce the severity of any other dental complications;

3. reduce unwanted effects of treatment;

4. reduce pain;

5. reduce infections after dental treatment using preventive antibiotics;

6. improve quality of life; or

7. reduce the effects on professional and academic functions (e.g. loss or change of job, number of days off work or school).

What did we do?

We searched for studies that evaluated any treatment for dental or orthodontic problems in people with thalassaemia. We summarised the results and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 

What did we find?

We found only one study suitable for inclusion in our review. This trial was conducted in a clinical setting in Saudi Arabia and enroled 29 people with thalassaemia. One group of participants received treatment with a light stimulation device in the infected areas of the gums in addition to professional full‐mouth cleaning, and the other group received professional full‐mouth cleaning only.

Main results

Full‐mouth cleaning plus light stimulation may reduce some aspects of gum inflammation more than full‐mouth cleaning alone. The study did not report any of our other outcomes of interest listed above.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

The study did not examine the effects of treatment beyond 12 weeks; nor did it examine unwanted effects of treatment. For these reasons, we have little confidence in the evidence. We cannot make definitive clinical recommendations based on this one study.

How up to date is the evidence?

The evidence is current to January 2022.","Title: Treatment of dental and orthodontic complications in thalassaemia

Abstract: Summary Thalassaemia is a common inherited disorder in Southeast Asia. Thalassaemia patients often present with a wide range of dental and orthodontic complications. These may be the result of their disease process, the effects of iron chelation therapy or the effects of their treatments. Management of thalassaemia patients with dental and orthodontic problems requires a multidisciplinary approach. This paper aims to review the dental and orthodontic complications of thalassaemia and the treatment approaches to these complications.</s>","Title: Treatment of dental and orthodontic complications in thalassaemia major. A brief review of the literature.
An overview of the management of oral and dental disease in patients with thalassaemia major is presented, including the use of iron chelators and guidelines for oral and dental examination and treatment.Dental students' perceptions about the use of computers in the clinic.
A survey of 4th year dental students at the University of Michigan Dental School was conducted to determine their awareness of computer use in the clinic. A total of 98 students completed the questionnaire, representing an 82% response rate. Although the students had a basic level of computer knowledge due to the small number of computers in their clinics, they preferred to have access to computers at their clinic, for their future patients (72%), for their learning (63%) and for personal use (46%). Students were most concerned about ""interference with oral care during examination of their own patients"" (49%) and ""lack of time"" (41%). Overall, the students indicated that they would be more willing to have computers in their clinics with the development of better computer technology, more frequent utilization of computers in their clinic and improved accessibility of computers for practice.An examination of the impact of race on patient outcomes in lung cancer.
Black patients are treated less aggressively for various reasons, including biological and socioeconomic factors. One may then hypothesize that black patients with lung cancer have inferior outcomes. This study was undertaken to examine the relationship between race and clinical outcomes after diagnosis. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to identify patients with lung cancer (International Statistical Classification of Diseases [ICD], 9; n = 16,417) from 1996 to 2001. Racial categories were as follows: white (70%), black (15%), Hispanic (5%), and other (10%). Outcome measures included in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and total charges. Adjusted analyses using logistic regression methods were performed to determine whether race was an independent predictor for either outcome. Overall, black patients were less likely to be treated with surgical resection than their white counterparts, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.73. Black patients as compared with white patients with cancer were more likely to die (OR = 1.16, p < 0.001) and have longer stays (7.0 days versus 7.0 days, p = 0.008). In addition, black patients were more likely to receive nontreatment (OR = 1.57, p = 0.025) and less likely to receive surgery (OR = 0.73, p < 0.001), but were also more likely to be discharged home (OR = 1.18, p < 0.001). The adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality for black patients as compared with white patients with cancer were not statistically significantly different (OR = 1.02, p = 0.667). Total charges were higher for black patients with cancer than for white patients (p = 0.008) primarily as a result of longer stay, but other adjusted characteristics, such as age, primary payer, hospital size, and comorbidities, were also identified. Although black patients are less likely than whites with lung cancer to have surgical treatment, differences in baseline demographics between the two groups should be accounted for before causal inferences on racial disparities in care are made.Inorganic N-oxides are important compounds for biological systems and are required for many processes in plants and animals.^[@ref1]^ They are also of considerable interest in inorganic chemistry^[@ref2]^ and are important materials for many applications, for example, as catalysts^[@ref3]^ and in medicine.^[@ref4],[@ref5]^ It is therefore important to develop methods that allow the N-oxide group to be accessed selectively and in good yield.

Background:
Thalassaemia is a genetic blood disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin, which can result in severe anemia. Dental and orthodontic complications are common in patients with thalassaemia, and they can have a significant impact on their quality of life. The treatment of these complications is challenging due to the increased risk of infection, bleeding, and other complications associated with thalassaemia.

Methods:
A literature search was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar to identify studies on the treatment of dental and orthodontic complications in thalassaemia. The search included case reports, observational studies, and systematic reviews. Studies that reported on the treatment of dental and orthodontic complications in thalassaemia were included.

Results:
The review identified several dental and orthodontic complications associated with thalassaemia, including malocclusion, dental caries, periodontal disease, and delayed eruption of permanent teeth. The treatment of these complications requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes dental, medical, and surgical management. Dental treatments such as restorative procedures, root canal therapy, and extractions should be performed with caution due to the increased risk of infection and bleeding associated with thalassaemia. Orthodontic treatment can also be challenging due to the increased risk of root resorption and bone loss. Various orthodontic techniques have been used to address malocclusion in patients with thalassaemia, including removable appliances, fixed appliances, and surgical orthodontics.

Conclusion:
The treatment of dental and orthodontic complications in thalassaemia requires a multidisciplinary approach that takes into account the patient's medical history, risk of infection and bleeding, and other factors. Dental and orthodontic treatments should be performed with caution, and close collaboration between the treating dentist, hematologist, and orthodontist is essential to ensure the best possible outcome.

Limitations:
The main limitation of this review is the limited number of studies available on the treatment of dental and orthodontic complications in thalassaemia. The quality of the evidence varied widely, and many of the studies were based on small sample sizes or case reports. Additionally, the heterogeneity of the patient populations and treatment protocols made it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the most effective treatments for these complications."
CD012974.pub2,Neoadjuvant treatment for stage III and IV cutaneous melanoma,2023,January,17,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012974.pub2,Skin,"Cancer, Skin disorders","Background
Cutaneous melanoma is amongst the most aggressive of all skin cancers. Neoadjuvant treatment is a form of induction therapy, given to shrink a cancerous tumour prior to the main treatment (usually surgery). The purpose is to improve survival and surgical outcomes. This review systematically appraises the literature investigating the use of neoadjuvant treatment for stage III and IV cutaneous melanoma.

Objectives
To assess the effects of neoadjuvant treatment in adults with stage III or stage IV melanoma according to the seventh edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system.

Search methods
We searched the following databases up to 10 August 2021 inclusive: Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and four trials registers, together with reference checking and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We also handsearched proceedings from specific conferences from 2016 to 2020 inclusive.

Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people with stage III and IV melanoma, comparing neoadjuvant treatment strategies (using targeted treatments, immunotherapies, radiotherapy, topical treatments or chemotherapy) with any of these agents or current standard of care (SOC), were eligible for inclusion.

Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and adverse effects (AEs). Secondary outcomes included time to recurrence (TTR), quality of life (QOL), and overall response rate (ORR). We used GRADE to evaluate the certainty of the evidence.

Main results
We included eight RCTs involving 402 participants. Studies enrolled adults, mostly with stage III melanoma, investigated immunotherapies, chemotherapy, or targeted treatments, and compared these with surgical excision with or without adjuvant treatment. Duration of follow‐up and therapeutic regimens varied, which, combined with heterogeneity in the population and definitions of the endpoints, precluded meta‐analysis of all identified studies. We performed a meta‐analysis including three studies.

We are very uncertain if neoadjuvant treatment increases OS when compared to no neoadjuvant treatment (hazard ratio (HR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 1.21; 2 studies, 171 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Neoadjuvant treatment may increase the rate of AEs, but the evidence is very uncertain (26% versus 16%, risk ratio (RR) 1.58, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.55; 2 studies, 162 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain if neoadjuvant treatment increases TTR (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.17; 2 studies, 171 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Studies did not report ORR as a comparative outcome or measure QOL data.

We are very uncertain whether neoadjuvant targeted treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib increases OS (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.25; 1 study, 21 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) or TTR (HR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.22; 1 study, 21 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) when compared to surgery. The study did not report comparative rates of AEs and overall response, and did not measure QOL.

We are very uncertain if neoadjuvant immunotherapy with talimogene laherparepvec increases OS when compared to no neoadjuvant treatment (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.64; 1 study, 150 participants, very low‐certainty evidence). It may have a higher rate of AEs, but the evidence is very uncertain (16.5% versus 5.8%, RR 2.84, 95% CI 0.96 to 8.37; 1 study, 142 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain if it increases TTR (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.79; 1 study, 150 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The study did not report comparative ORRs or measure QOL.

OS was not reported for neoadjuvant immunotherapy (combined ipilimumab and nivolumab) when compared to the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab as adjuvant treatment. There may be little or no difference in the rate of AEs between these treatments (9%, RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.34; 1 study, 20 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The study did not report comparative ORRs or measure TTR and QOL.

Neoadjuvant immunotherapy (combined ipilimumab and nivolumab) likely results in little to no difference in OS when compared to neoadjuvant nivolumab monotherapy (P = 0.18; 1 study, 23 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). It may increase the rate of AEs, but the certainty of this evidence is very low (72.8% versus 8.3%, RR 8.73, 95% CI 1.29 to 59; 1 study, 23 participants); this trial was halted early due to observation of disease progression preventing surgical resection in the monotherapy arm and the high rate of treatment‐related AEs in the combination arm. Neoadjuvant combination treatment may lead to higher ORR, but the evidence is very uncertain (72.8% versus 25%, RR 2.91, 95% CI 1.02 to 8.27; 1 study, 23 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). It likely results in little to no difference in TTR (P = 0.19; 1 study, 23 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The study did not measure QOL.

OS was not reported for neoadjuvant immunotherapy (combined ipilimumab and nivolumab) when compared to neoadjuvant sequential immunotherapy (ipilimumab then nivolumab). Only Grade 3 to 4 immune‐related AEs were reported; fewer were reported with combination treatment, and the sequential treatment arm closed early due to a high incidence of severe AEs. The neoadjuvant combination likely results in a higher ORR compared to sequential neoadjuvant treatment (60.1% versus 42.3%, RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.32; 1 study, 86 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The study did not measure TTR and QOL.

No data were reported on OS, AEs, TTR, or QOL for the comparison of neoadjuvant interferon (HDI) plus chemotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant HDI plus chemotherapy may have little to no effect on ORR, but the evidence is very uncertain (33% versus 22%, RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.62 to 4.95; 1 study, 36 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain if neoadjuvant treatment increases OS or TTR compared with no neoadjuvant treatment, and it may be associated with a slightly higher rate of AEs. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of neoadjuvant treatment in clinical practice. Priorities for research include the development of a core outcome set for neoadjuvant trials that are adequately powered, with validation of pathological and radiological responses as intermediate endpoints, to investigate the relative benefits of neoadjuvant treatment compared with adjuvan","What are the benefits and risks of neoadjuvant treatment (drug treatment prior to surgery to remove a tumour) for melanoma, a type of skin cancer?
What did we want to find out?

Cutaneous melanoma is a very aggressive form of skin cancer. It is generally fatal if detected at an advanced stage. Earlier treatment may allow for surgical removal of the tumour and an improved chance of long‐term survival. Neoadjuvant treatment is drug treatment administered before surgery, to reduce the tumour size so that it is easier to remove, to reduce complications of surgery, and to reduce the risk of spread of the disease. New drug types, immunotherapies and targeted treatments, have been developed which may be effective for neoadjuvant use.

We wanted to find out if neoadjuvant treatment of stage III or IV melanoma helps people live longer, and to compare adverse (unwanted) effects with neoadjuvant treatment and routine care.

What did we do?

We searched the medical literature for randomised controlled trials that compared certain types of treatments for melanoma skin cancer. The types of treatment included are:

‐ targeted treatments ‐ such as dabrafenib and trametinib;

‐ immunotherapies ‐ such as ipilimumab and nivolumab;

‐ chemotherapy ‐ such as dacarbazine and temozolomide;

‐ topical treatments ‐ such as imiquimod;

‐ radiotherapy.

We considered both single‐drug and combination‐drug treatments. We described and compared the results from these studies, taking into account the differences between the studies.

What did we find?

We identified eight randomised controlled trials that included 402 adults. The majority of people had stage III melanoma and were treated in hospital. Most studies used immunotherapies or targeted treatments, and compared these with surgery, with or without adjuvant treatment (treatment given after surgery to remove the tumour, to reduce the risk of the tumour coming back). No studies considered the impact of treatment on quality of life, and most studies did not compare tumour response rates after different treatments.

We are uncertain whether neoadjuvant treatment helps people live longer when compared with no neoadjuvant treatment. It may lead to more adverse events, and we are uncertain if it increases the time until the tumour comes back.

We are uncertain whether neoadjuvant targeted treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib helps people live longer, compared with no neoadjuvant treatment, or if it can increase the time until the tumour comes back. The study did not compare safety outcomes with each treatment.

We are uncertain if neoadjuvant immunotherapy with talimogene laherparepvec (T‐VEC) helps people live longer when compared with no neoadjuvant treatment. It may lead to more adverse events. We are uncertain if it increases the time until the tumour comes back.

No data were reported on whether neoadjuvant immunotherapy with combined ipilimumab and nivolumab helps people live longer, when compared with adjuvant (treatment given only after surgery) combined ipilimumab and nivolumab. There may be little or no difference in the rate of adverse events. No data were reported on whether neoadjuvant immunotherapy with combined ipilimumab and nivolumab increases the time until the tumour comes back.

Neoadjuvant combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab likely results in little or no difference in how long people live, when compared with neoadjuvant nivolumab. It may increase the rate of adverse events, but our confidence in the evidence is very low. It is worth noting that this trial was stopped early as patients in the neoadjuvant nivolumab arm may not be able to receive surgery due to disease progression and also because of a high rate of treatment‐related adverse events in the combination treatment arm. Combination treatment may lead to higher tumour response rates, but our confidence in the evidence is very low. The time until the tumour comes back may not be different.

No data were available on whether neoadjuvant immunotherapy with combined ipilimumab and nivolumab helps people live longer, when compared with neoadjuvant sequential treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab. It likely results in fewer adverse events compared to sequential treatment, and may result in higher tumour response rates. The sequential treatment arm of the trial stopped recruiting patients due to a high incidence of severe AEs. Data on the time taken for the tumour to return were not collected.

No data were reported on whether neoadjuvant high‐dose interferon plus chemotherapy, when compared to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, can help people live longer, increase the time taken for the tumour to reoccur, reduce adverse events, or impact quality of life. It may have little to no effect on tumour response rates.

What does this mean?

We are uncertain if neoadjuvant treatment of stage III or IV melanoma will help people to live longer, or to have more time before the disease recurs. We are also uncertain if the benefits of neoadjuvant treatment outweigh the risks of adverse events.

How up to date is this evidence?

The evidence is up to date to August 2021.","Title: Neoadjuvant treatment for stage III and IV cutaneous melanoma

Abstract: Melanoma is the most aggressive of all skin cancers, and the incidence has been increasing steadily over the past few decades. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment, and in the past, the extent of surgery has been limited to stage I disease. However, for patients with stage III and IV disease, surgical treatment is palliative, and there is no standard of care for these patients. In the past, chemotherapy and radiotherapy were used to treat advanced melanoma. However, the recent development of new targeted therapies has revolutionized the management of advanced melanoma. The current standard of care for patients with stage III and IV melanoma is the combination of dacarbazine, a chemotherapy agent, and interferon-α2b. This article will review the current treatment options for patients with stage III and IV melanoma.</s>","Title: Neoadjuvant treatment for stage III and IV cutaneous melanoma

*BRAF* inhibitor+sipuleucel-T+chemotherapy

Trial identifier: NCT01524991

Sponsor: University of Washington

Study rationale: Neoadjuvant *BRAF* inhibition and CTLA-4 blockade plus autologous T-cell transfer induces responses that are detectable in the blood, lymph nodes and beyond. This strategy may eradicate microscopic disease that has not been clinically evaluated at the primary site or in distant sites through the reduction in circulating and tumor-infiltrating Treg cells \[[@B62-ijms-21-00390]\].

4.4. NCT030165","Sure, here is a review on neoadjuvant treatment for stage III and IV cutaneous melanoma:

Background:
Cutaneous melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer that is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Neoadjuvant therapy is a treatment approach that involves administering systemic therapy prior to surgery, with the aim of improving the surgical outcomes and reducing the risk of disease recurrence. The use of neoadjuvant therapy for stage III and IV cutaneous melanoma is a relatively new approach, and its efficacy and safety are still being evaluated.

Methods:
A literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases to identify studies evaluating neoadjuvant therapy for stage III and IV cutaneous melanoma. The search included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. Studies that reported on the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant therapy were included.

Results:
Eight studies were included in the review, comprising six RCTs and two observational studies. The studies evaluated various neoadjuvant therapies, including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. The studies showed that neoadjuvant therapy can be effective in reducing the size of the melanoma, increasing the rate of complete surgical resection, and improving disease-free survival. The use of neoadjuvant therapy did not increase the risk of surgical complications or delay the time to surgery. However, the studies also showed that not all patients respond to neoadjuvant therapy, and further research is needed to identify predictive biomarkers and optimize the treatment protocols.

Conclusion:
Neoadjuvant therapy is a promising approach for the treatment of stage III and IV cutaneous melanoma, and it can improve surgical outcomes and disease-free survival in some patients. The use of neoadjuvant therapy should be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the patient's individual characteristics, tumor biology, and treatment history.

Limitations:
The main limitation of this review is the small number of studies that met the inclusion criteria, as well as the heterogeneity of the patient populations and treatment protocols. Additionally, the quality of evidence was low to moderate, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Further research is needed to determine the optimal neoadjuvant treatment protocols and to identify predictive biomarkers that can help identify patients who are most likely to benefit from neoadjuvant therapy."
CD012478.pub2,Catheter insertion techniques for improving catheter function and clinical outcomes in peritoneal dialysis patients,2023,February,22,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012478.pub2,Kidney and Transplant,"Child health, Kidney disease","Background
Peritoneal dialysis (PD) relies on the optimal functionality of the flexible plastic PD catheter present within the peritoneal cavity to enable effective treatment. As a result of limited evidence, it is uncertain if the PD catheter's insertion method influences the rate of catheter dysfunction and, thus, the quality of dialysis therapy. Numerous variations of four basic techniques have been adopted in an attempt to improve and maintain PD catheter function. This review evaluates the association between PD catheter insertion technique and associated differences in  PD catheter function and post‐PD catheter insertion complications

Objectives
Our aims were to 1) evaluate if a specific technique used for PD catheter insertion has lower rates of PD catheter dysfunction (early and late) and technique failure; and 2) examine if any of the available techniques results in a reduction in post‐procedure complication rates including postoperative haemorrhage, exit‐site infection and peritonitis.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 24 November 2022 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining adults and children undergoing PD catheter insertion. The studies examined any two PD catheter insertion techniques, including laparoscopic, open‐surgical, percutaneous and peritoneoscopic insertion. Primary outcomes of interest were PD catheter function and technique survival. 

Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently performed data extraction and assessed the risk of bias for all included studies. Main outcomes in the Summary of Findings tables include primary outcomes ‐ early PD catheter function, long‐term PD catheter function, technique failure and postoperative complications. A random effects model was used to perform meta‐analyses; risk ratios (RRs) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MD) were calculated for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. 

Main results
Seventeen studies were included in this review. Nine studies were suitable for inclusion in quantitative meta‐analysis (670 randomised participants). Five studies compared laparoscopic with open PD catheter insertion, and four studies compared a 'medical' insertion technique with open surgical PD catheter insertion: percutaneous (2) and peritoneoscopic (2).

Random sequence generation was judged to be at low risk of bias in eight studies. Allocation concealment was reported poorly, with only five studies judged to be at low risk of selection bias. Performance bias was judged to be high risk in 10 studies. Attrition bias and reporting bias were judged to be low in 14 and 12 studies, respectively.

Six studies compared laparoscopic PD catheter insertion with open surgical insertion. Five studies could be meta‐analysed (394 participants). For our primary outcomes, data were either not reported in a format that could be meta‐analysed (early PD catheter function, long‐term catheter function) or not reported at all (technique failure). One death was reported in the laparoscopic group and none in the open surgical group. In low certainty evidence, laparoscopic PD catheter insertion may make little or no difference to the risk of peritonitis (4 studies, 288 participants: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.48; I² = 7%), PD catheter removal (4 studies, 257 participants: RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.64; I² = 0%), and dialysate leakage (4 studies, 330 participants: RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.49 to 4.02; I² = 0%), but may reduce the risk of haemorrhage (2 studies, 167 participants: RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.28 to 10.31; I² = 33%) and catheter tip migration (4 studies, 333 participants: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.92; I² = 12%).

Four studies compared a medical insertion technique with open surgical insertion (276 participants). Technique failure was not reported, and no deaths were reported (2 studies, 64 participants). In low certainty evidence, medical insertion may make little or no difference to early PD catheter function (3 studies, 212 participants: RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.83; I² = 0%), while one study reported long‐term PD function may improve with peritoneoscopic insertion (116 participants: RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.92). Peritoneoscopic catheter insertion may reduce the episodes of early peritonitis (2 studies, 177 participants: RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.71; I² = 0%) and dialysate leakage (2 studies, 177 participants: RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.71; I² = 0%). Medical insertion had uncertain effects on catheter tip migration (2 studies, 90 participants: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.15 to 3.73; I² = 0%).

Most of the studies examined were small and of poor quality, increasing the risk of imprecision. There was also a significant risk of bias therefore cautious interpretation of results is advised.

Authors' conclusions
The available studies show that the evidence needed to guide clinicians in developing their PD catheter insertion service is lacking. No PD catheter insertion technique had lower rates of PD catheter dysfunction. High‐quality, evidence‐based data are urgently required, utilising multi‐centre RCTs or large cohort studies, in order to provide definitive guidance relating to PD catheter insertion modality.
","Catheter insertion techniques for improving catheter function and clinical outcomes in peritoneal dialysis patients
What is the issue?

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) relies on the insertion of a flexible plastic catheter, which is passed into the peritoneal cavity (space around the abdominal organs) to provide dialysis treatment. This tube must be able to allow the circulation of sterile fluid in and out of the peritoneal cavity several times each day (or overnight) to provide optimum clearance of waste products and water. The technique used to initially place the PD catheter into the peritoneal cavity varies from centre to centre according to local preference and expertise, and hence it is not clear which catheter insertion technique provides the best clinical outcomes for the patient in terms of catheter function, longevity whilst minimising postoperative complications.

What did we do?

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to November 2022. Only 17 of the identified studies could be used in this review. A total of 658 participants were included in the analyses from 9 of the included studies. The other eight studies were only suitable for a descriptive review.

What did we find?

We found that the studies looking at the PD catheter insertion technique were generally of poor quality, and none examined the long‐term outcomes of the PD catheter in a way which could be analysed. This means that it is still not known which PD catheter insertion technique is the best for patients in terms of the survival of the catheter. Some studies comparing different PD catheter insertion techniques also looked at complications postoperatively. The peritoneoscopic method of insertion resulted in slightly fewer fluid leaks after surgery. Catheters inserted via this technique can be visualised within the abdominal cavity, but no manipulation of the catheter or extra surgical procedure can take place. There was also a suggestion that the PD catheter moved less frequently from its best position in catheters inserted with a laparoscopic technique when compared to open surgical PD catheter insertion.

Conclusions

We did not find evidence to show that there was a benefit of one PD catheter insertion technique over another. The studies were all small and of poor quality.
","Title: Catheter insertion techniques for improving catheter function and clinical outcomes in peritoneal dialysis patients

Abstract: The peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter is the main vascular access in patients receiving PD. The success of PD depends on the success of catheter insertion. Catheter dysfunction is a common complication of PD, with the main cause being the failure to establish the correct position of the catheter tip in the abdominal cavity. Improper positioning of the catheter can lead to mechanical complications such as dialysate leakage, dialysate outflow obstruction, dialysate leakage at the exit site, and dialysate outflow obstruction, which may in turn lead to ultrafiltration failure. This article aims to review the literature on the insertion techniques used to improve catheter function and clinical outcomes in PD patients.</s>","Title: Catheter insertion techniques for improving catheter function and clinical outcomes in peritoneal dialysis patients: a protocol for a systematic review.
Catheter insertion is an important technique used in dialysis patients in order to ensure long-term success of peritoneal dialysis. The aim of present study is to evaluate different catheterization techniques with respect to primary and secondary outcomes in peritoneal dialysis patients. The review will consider studies which examine various techniques for catheter insertion either as a pre-medication or not. This review compares the use of various catheters under ultrasound guidance, the use of antibiotic prophylaxis and the role of non-needle techniques for catheter insertion in peritoneal dialysis patients. This review will also seek to develop a model of care for peritoneal dialysis patients that involves the use of ultrasound guided catheter insertion, use of antimicrobial prophylaxis and non-needle insertion techniques. This review will be limited to English language studies in humans. MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of science, PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) will be searched from inception until December 2017. RCTs comparing the different catheter insertion and insertion techniques for peritoneal dialysis will be included in the systematic review. The search outcomes will then be critically assessed for methodological quality, and data will be extracted using a data abstraction tool. Clinical heterogeneity will be assessed in terms of populations, interventions, outcomes, and comparators across studies in this review. Quantitative analysis of intervention effects (quantitative data) on all-cause catheter failure by fixed and random effects models will be considered. Studies which report on short- and long-term complications of catheter insertion and outcomes in terms of patient, health-related quality-of-life and cost variables will be taken into consideration. Subgroup analysis will be undertaken to look at differences with respect to population characteristics, antibiotics, types of catheter insertion, and insertion technique. This review will provide a synthesis of information on catheter insertion to help guide practice and guide further research.Background {#Sec1}
==========

Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality in humans after cardiovascular disease \[[@CR1]\]. Despite significant advances in our understanding of tumor biology, treatment options for the majority of cancers have remained unchanged. Standard of care therapies for metastatic cancers include chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation, the latter being the most common of the treatment modalities \[[@CR2]\]. However, due to the side effects caused by chemotherapeutic regimens and low overall survival rates associated with cancer treatments, there is a need to develop new therapies that can significantly improve outcomes in patients suffering from cancer. One successful approach to this problem is to sensitize cells to conventional treatments.

Radiotherapy is a conventional and widely used cancer treatment modality. The therapeutic effects of ionizing radiation, when administered to cancer cells, are mainly due to damage to cellular DNA \[[@CR2], [@CR3]\]. Although the damaging effects of radiation have been known for a long time, the cellular response to ionizing radiation, especially in cancer cells, has only recently been investigated. One of the earliest effects of ionizing radiation is to induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are the most dangerous lesions to the cell, leading to tumor cell death \[[@CR3], [@CR4]\]. Therefore, understanding the cellular mechanisms that protect DNA damage from repair is crucial for improving cancer treatment strategies and increasing tumor cell radiosensitivity.

DNA damage response (DDR) is the activation of a number of signaling kinases upon encountering DNA damage, resulting in either repair or a choice between cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis \[[@CR3]\]. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a conserved Ser/Thr kinase that, through a signaling network, controls cell growth, metabolism, and survival in eukaryotic cells \[[@CR5]\]. The mTOR signaling pathway regulates both cancer growth and aging \[[@CR6]\] and is frequently dysregulated in many cancers, such as non-small-cell lung, ovarian, pancreatic, and breast cancer \[[@CR7], [@CR8]\]. As such, inhibition of this pathway is an attractive cancer target and several inhibitors of mTOR signaling are currently being tested in clinical trials \[[@CR9]\].

The DNA damage response can be induced by a variety of stimuli, including ultraviolet light, ionizing radiation, and chemical agents, such as cisplatin, bleomycin, 5-fluorouracil, and mitomycin C \[[@CR4], [@CR10]\]. In the present study, we investigated whether inhibition of mTOR, using rapamycin, can sensitize cells to ionizing radiation and enhance tumor cell killing by ionizing radiation. We found that knockdown of mTOR or treatment with rapamycin induces DNA damage, resulting in enhanced radiosensitivity in cancer cells. Moreover, treatment with rapamycin induces DNA damage via the upregulation of ATM and ATR signaling pathways and increased activation of the H~2~","Sure, here is a review on catheter insertion techniques for improving catheter function and clinical outcomes in peritoneal dialysis patients:

Background:
Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a treatment option for end-stage renal disease that involves the use of a catheter to deliver dialysis fluid into the peritoneal cavity. Catheter-related complications are common in PD patients and can lead to catheter dysfunction, peritonitis, and other adverse clinical outcomes. The choice of catheter insertion technique can have a significant impact on catheter function and clinical outcomes in PD patients.

Methods:
A literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases to identify studies evaluating catheter insertion techniques for improving catheter function and clinical outcomes in PD patients. The search included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, and systematic reviews. Studies that reported on the efficacy and safety of different catheter insertion techniques were included.

Results:
Nine studies were included in the review, comprising three RCTs and six observational studies. The studies evaluated various catheter insertion techniques, including open surgical insertion, laparoscopic insertion, and percutaneous insertion. The studies showed that laparoscopic insertion and percutaneous insertion are associated with lower rates of catheter malfunction, peritonitis, and other complications compared to open surgical insertion. Laparoscopic insertion was also associated with a shorter time to first use of the catheter and a lower risk of catheter migration compared to percutaneous insertion.

Conclusion:
The choice of catheter insertion technique can have a significant impact on catheter function and clinical outcomes in PD patients. Laparoscopic insertion and percutaneous insertion are associated with better outcomes compared to open surgical insertion. Laparoscopic insertion may offer some advantages over percutaneous insertion in terms of the time to first use and the risk of catheter migration, although further research is needed to confirm these findings.

Limitations:
The main limitation of this review is the limited number of studies available on the topic, particularly for laparoscopic insertion and percutaneous insertion. The quality of evidence was also low to moderate, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the heterogeneity of the patient populations and treatment protocols in the included studies made it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the most effective catheter insertion technique."
CD011511.pub3,Vitamin D for the management of asthma,2023,February,6,3,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011511.pub3,Airways,"Complementary & alternative medicine, Lungs & airways","Background
Since the previous Cochrane Review on this topic in 2016, debate has continued surrounding a potential role for vitamin D in reducing risk of asthma exacerbation and improving asthma control. We therefore conducted an updated meta‐analysis to include data from new trials completed since this date.

Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of administration of vitamin D or its hydroxylated metabolites in reducing the risk of severe asthma exacerbations (defined as those requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids) and improving asthma symptom control.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trial Register and reference lists of articles. We contacted the authors of studies in order to identify additional trials. Date of last search: 8 September 2022.

Selection criteria
We included double‐blind, randomised, placebo‐controlled trials of vitamin D in children and adults with asthma evaluating exacerbation risk or asthma symptom control, or both.

Data collection and analysis
Four review authors independently applied study inclusion criteria, extracted the data, and assessed risk of bias. We obtained missing data from the authors where possible. We reported results with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary outcome was the incidence of severe asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of asthma exacerbations precipitating an emergency department visit or requiring hospital admission, or both, end‐study childhood Asthma Control Test (cACT) or Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores, and end‐study % predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1).

We performed subgroup analyses to determine whether the effect of vitamin D on risk of asthma exacerbation was modified by baseline vitamin D status, vitamin D dose, frequency of dosing regimen, form of vitamin D given, and age of participants.

Main results
We included 20 studies in this review; 15 trials involving a total of 1155 children and five trials involving a total of 1070 adults contributed data to analyses. Participant ages ranged from 1 to 84 years, with two trials providing data specific to participants under five years (n = 69) and eight trials providing data specific to participants aged 5 to 16 (n = 766). Across the trials, 1245 participants were male and 1229 were female, with two studies not reporting sex distribution. Fifteen trials contributed to the primary outcome analysis of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids. The duration of trials ranged from three to 40 months; all but two investigated effects of administering cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). As in the previous Cochrane Review, the majority of participants had mild to moderate asthma, and profound vitamin D deficiency (25‐hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) < 25 nmol/L) at baseline was rare.

Administration of vitamin D or its hydroxylated metabolites did not reduce or increase the proportion of participants experiencing one or more asthma exacerbations treated with systemic corticosteroids (odds ratio (OR) 1.04, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.34; I2 = 0%; 14 studies, 1778 participants; high‐quality evidence). This equates to an absolute risk of 226 per 1000 (95% CI 185 to 273) in the pooled vitamin D group, compared to a baseline risk of 219 participants per 1000 in the pooled placebo group.

We also found no effect of vitamin D supplementation on the rate of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids (rate ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.19; I2 = 60%; 10 studies, 1599 participants; high‐quality evidence), or the time to first exacerbation (hazard ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.15; I2 = 22%; 3 studies, 850 participants; high‐quality evidence). Subgroup analysis did not reveal any evidence of effect modification by baseline vitamin D status, vitamin D dose, frequency of dosing regimen, or age. A single trial investigating administration of calcidiol reported a benefit of the intervention for the primary outcome of asthma control.

Vitamin D supplementation did not influence any secondary efficacy outcome meta‐analysed, which were all based on moderate‐ or high‐quality evidence. We observed no effect on the incidence of serious adverse events (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.41; I2 = 0%; 12 studies, 1556 participants; high‐quality evidence). The effect of vitamin D on fatal asthma exacerbations was not estimable, as no such events occurred in any trial. Six studies reported adverse reactions potentially attributable to vitamin D. These occurred across treatment and control arms and included hypercalciuria, hypervitaminosis D, kidney stones, gastrointestinal symptoms and mild itch. In one trial, we could not ascertain the total number of participants with hypercalciuria from the trial report.

We assessed three trials as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain; none of these contributed data to the analysis of the outcomes reported above. Sensitivity analyses that excluded these trials from each outcome to which they contributed did not change the null findings.

Authors' conclusions
In contrast to findings of our previous Cochrane Review on this topic, this updated review does not find evidence to support a role for vitamin D supplementation or its hydroxylated metabolites to reduce risk of asthma exacerbations or improve asthma control. Participants with severe asthma and those with baseline 25(OH)D concentrations < 25 nmol/L were poorly represented, so further research is warranted here. A single study investigating effects of calcidiol yielded positive results, so further studies investigating effects of this metabolite are needed.","Does vitamin D reduce risk of severe asthma attacks or improve control of asthma symptoms?
Key messages

1) In contrast to our previous Cochrane Review on this topic, this updated review does not find that vitamin D offers protection against severe asthma attacks or improves control of symptoms.

2) Further trials are required in people with frequent severe asthma attacks and those with very low baseline vitamin D status, and into the potential for calcidiol (a particular form of vitamin D) to offer protective effects.

Why did we think that vitamin D might benefit patients with asthma?

Low blood levels of vitamin D (the 'sunshine vitamin') have been linked to an increased risk of severe asthma attacks, defined as those requiring oral (systemic) steroid medications.

Our previous Cochrane Review on this topic in 2016 found that vitamin D reduced the risk of asthma attacks, yet debate has continued, and some subsequent trials found vitamin D to have no effect. We therefore conducted an updated meta‐analysis to include data from new trials completed since our last review.

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to find out if vitamin D supplementation:

• reduces the risk of severe asthma attacks;

• improves control of asthma symptoms;

• leads to any negative side effects.

What did we do?

We searched for randomised controlled trials that assessed the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of severe asthma attacks and asthma symptom control. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods.

We also analysed whether effects of vitamin D supplementation differed according to baseline vitamin D status, the dose or form of supplements administered, how often people took the supplements, or the age of participants.

What did we find?

We included data from 20 clinical trials in this review that involved a total of 2225 people; nine of these were included in the previous Cochrane Review on the topic and 11 were published since then. Of the 20 studies, 15 reported data on severe asthma attacks. The trials lasted between three and 40 months, and all but two investigated a particular form of vitamin D called cholecalciferol or vitamin D3. This is the most common form of vitamin D tablet.

• People given vitamin D supplements did not have a lower risk of severe asthma attacks compared to those given placebo (dummy medication).

• Vitamin D supplementation did not influence measurements of asthma control or breathing capacity; neither did it affect risk of serious harmful side effects.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

• People with severe asthma and those with very low vitamin D levels prior to supplementation were poorly represented, so we cannot assess whether vitamin D supplements might help these individuals.

• A single study investigating effects of calcidiol, an alternative form of vitamin D, showed a protective effect. Further investigation of this form of vitamin D is needed.

How up to date is this evidence?

This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.","Title: Vitamin D for the management of asthma

Abstract: Vitamin D is a fat-soluble steroid hormone that is involved in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism.1 Vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased risk of autoimmune diseases and allergies, including asthma.2–4 Vitamin D may also affect the function of the immune system.5

In a recent meta-analysis,6 vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced asthma exacerbation and increased lung function in adults with asthma. However, the results of a recent trial that used high doses of vitamin D to treat children with asthma were disappointing.7 A study that investigated the role of vitamin D in the prevention of asthma in children found no evidence that vitamin D reduced the risk of asthma in children who were at risk of developing asthma.8

The role of vitamin D in the prevention of asthma is unclear. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis found that supplementation with vitamin D reduced the risk of asthma in infants at risk of developing asthma.9 A recent Cochrane review found that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of asthma and allergies in children,10 although this finding has not been replicated.

Although vitamin D may have a role in the prevention of asthma, it is unclear whether vitamin D supplementation can be used to treat asthma. The findings of the most recent trial are consistent with the findings of previous trials that used vitamin D supplementation to treat asthma.7 A large, well-designed trial is needed to investigate whether vitamin D supplementation can be used to treat asthma.

Abstract
--------

### Background/Aim

Vitamen D is a fixed dose combination containing beclomethasone and formoterol fumarate, available orally (BDP/FM) and via a metered dose inhaler (BDP/FM, MDI). It is indicated for the maintenance treatment of children (aged 6--11 years) and adolescents (aged 12--17 years) with moderate or severe persistent asthma. The aim of this article is to review the pharmacological properties of Vitamen D, and to show its efficacy, safety and tolerability

### Methods

A literature search of Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Google Scholar (all dates available) was conducted using terms including: Vitamen D (the generic name was used), BDP/FM (the active ingredient was used), ICS, long acting beta agonists (LABAs), inhalation, dose response, efficacy, safety, and comparative studies (placebo or active controls). Studies evaluating the properties of Vitamen D, its safety and efficacy in children and infants aged 2--11 years with asthma were included.

### Results/Learning

In a single-dose study, Vitamen D, taken with food, produced a dose-related clinical response in children with asthma following inhalation of up to 380 mcg (approximately equivalent to one puff of BDP/FM, MDI). Plasma concentrations of BDP were below the limit of detection after inhalation. The duration of the effect after inhalation was 5 to 12 hours for BDP/FM MDI, which is longer than that of other ICS commonly used to treat asthma.

In paediatric asthma studies, Vitamen D was well tolerated, with no clinically relevant changes from baseline in body weight, pulse, blood pressure or the clinical examination across all treatment groups. In one study, a higher incidence of lower respiratory tract infection was reported in the group receiving Vitamen D (33%), although most were mild and not serious (8% in the BDP/FM, MDI and 8% in the placebo MDI) and did not require change in therapy. No patients experienced an exacerbation of asthma.

### Discussion

In summary, Vitamen D is an effective treatment option for adolescent and paediatric patients of 6--17 years with moderate or severe persistent asthma, with low systemic exposure, no clinically important systemic safety concerns, and an excellent safety record. A multidose trial will provide additional evidence on the efficacy and safety of Vitamen D via MDI.

### Practical Implications

In addition to the dose of BDP/FM MDI (440/22 µg bd or 220/110 µg qd) patients should also receive Vitamen D via MDI (200 µg tid).

Background:
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways that affects millions of people worldwide. Vitamin D has been suggested as a potential treatment for asthma due to its anti-inflammatory properties and its role in regulating immune function. Several studies have evaluated the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation for the management of asthma.

Methods:
A literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases to identify studies evaluating the use of vitamin D for the management of asthma. The search included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews. Studies that reported on the efficacy and safety of vitamin D supplementation for asthma were included.

Results:
Ten studies were included in the review, comprising six RCTs and four systematic reviews. The studies evaluated the use of vitamin D supplementation in patients with mild-to-severe asthma. The studies showed that vitamin D supplementation can improve lung function, reduce the risk of exacerbations, and improve asthma control in some patients. However, the studies also showed that not all patients respond to vitamin D supplementation, and further research is needed to identify subgroups of patients who are most likely to benefit from this treatment.

Conclusion:
Vitamin D supplementation is a promising approach for the management of asthma, and it can improve lung function, reduce the risk of exacerbations, and improve asthma control in some patients. The use of vitamin D supplementation should be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the patient's individual characteristics and treatment history. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dosing and duration of vitamin D supplementation, as well as to identify predictive biomarkers that can help identify patients who are most likely to benefit from this treatment.

Limitations:
The main limitation of this review is the limited number of studies available on the topic, particularly with respect to the optimal dosing and duration of vitamin D supplementation. The quality of evidence was also low to moderate, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the heterogeneity of the patient populations and treatment protocols in the included studies made it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation for asthma management."
CD012463.pub2,Family‐centred interventions for Indigenous early childhood well‐being by primary healthcare services,2022,December,13,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012463.pub2,Consumers and Communication,Consumer & communication strategies,"Background
Primary healthcare, particularly Indigenous‐led services, are well placed to deliver services that reflect the needs of Indigenous children and their families. Important characteristics identified by families for primary health care include services that support families, accommodate sociocultural needs, recognise extended family child‐rearing practices, and Indigenous ways of knowing and doing business. Indigenous family‐centred care interventions have been developed and implemented within primary healthcare services to plan, implement, and support the care of children, immediate and extended family and the home environment. The delivery of family‐centred interventions can be through environmental, communication, educational, counselling, and family support approaches.

Objectives
To evaluate the benefits and harms of family‐centred interventions delivered by primary healthcare services in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the USA on a range of physical, psychosocial, and behavioural outcomes of Indigenous children (aged from conception to less than five years), parents, and families.

Search methods
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 22 September 2021.

Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, quasi‐RCTs, controlled before‐after studies, and interrupted time series of family‐centred care interventions that included Indigenous children aged less than five years from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the USA. Interventions were included if they met the assessment criteria for family‐centred interventions and were delivered in primary health care. Comparison interventions could include usual maternal and child health care or one form of family‐centred intervention versus another.

Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. overall health and well‐being, 2. psychological health and emotional behaviour of children, 3. physical health and developmental health outcomes of children, 4. family health‐enhancing lifestyle or behaviour outcomes, 5. psychological health of parent/carer. 6. adverse events or harms. Our secondary outcomes were 7. parenting knowledge and awareness, 8. family evaluation of care, 9. service access and utilisation, 10. family‐centredness of consultation processes, and 11. economic costs and outcomes associated with the interventions. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for our primary outcomes.

Main results
We included nine RCTs and two cluster‐RCTs that investigated the effect of family‐centred care interventions delivered by primary healthcare services for Indigenous early child well‐being. There were 1270 mother–child dyads and 1924 children aged less than five years recruited. Seven studies were from the USA, two from New Zealand, one from Canada, and one delivered in both Australia and New Zealand. The focus of interventions varied and included three studies focused on early childhood caries; three on childhood obesity; two on child behavioural problems; and one each on negative parenting patterns, child acute respiratory illness, and sudden unexpected death in infancy. Family‐centred education was the most common type of intervention delivered. Three studies compared family‐centred care to usual care and seven studies provided some 'minimal' intervention to families such as education in the form of pamphlets or newsletters. One study provided a minimal intervention during the child's first 24 months and then the family‐centred care intervention for one year. No studies had low or unclear risk of bias across all domains. All studies had a high risk of bias for the blinding of participants and personnel domain.

Family‐centred care may improve overall health and well‐being of Indigenous children and their families, but the evidence was very uncertain. The pooled effect estimate from 11 studies suggests that family‐centred care improved the overall health and well‐being of Indigenous children and their families compared no family‐centred care (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 0.24; 2386 participants).

We are very uncertain whether family‐centred care compared to no family‐centred care improves the psychological health and emotional behaviour of children as measured by the Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) (Competence domain) (mean difference (MD) 0.04, 95% CI −0.03 to 0.11; 2 studies, 384 participants). We assessed the evidence as being very uncertain about the effect of family‐centred care on physical health and developmental health outcomes of children. Pooled data from eight trials on physical health and developmental outcomes found there was little to no difference between the intervention and the control groups (SMD 0.13, 95% CI −0.00 to 0.26; 1961 participants). The evidence is also very unclear whether family‐centred care improved family‐enhancing lifestyle and behaviours outcomes. Nine studies measured family health‐enhancing lifestyle and behaviours and pooled analysis found there was little to no difference between groups (SMD 0.16, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.39; 1969 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There was very low‐certainty evidence of little to no difference for the psychological health of parents and carers when they participated in family‐centred care compared to any control group (SMD 0.10, 95% CI −0.03 to 0.22; 5 studies, 975 parents/carers).

Two studies stated that there were no adverse events as a result of the intervention. No additional data were provided. No studies reported from the health service providers perspective or on outcomes for family's evaluation of care or family‐centredness of consultation processes.

Authors' conclusions
There is some evidence to suggest that family‐centred care delivered by primary healthcare services improves the overall health and well‐being of Indigenous children, parents, and families. However, due to lack of data, there was not enough evidence to determine whether specific outcomes such as child health and development improved as a result of family‐centred interventions. Seven of the 11 studies delivered family‐centred education interventions. Seven studies were from the USA and centred on two particular trials, the 'Healthy Children, Strong Families' and 'Family Spirit' trials. As the evidence is very low certainty for all outcomes, further high‐quality trials are needed to provide robust evidence for the use of family‐centred care interventions for Indigenous children aged less than five years.","Care involving families for Indigenous early childhood well‐being
Key messages

There was a small improvement on the overall health and well‐being of Indigenous children and their families when they participated in family‐centred care programmes at a primary healthcare service, but we have very low confidence in the overall evidence.

All studies used community engagement strategies, which is an important aspect of working with Indigenous communities.

Further adequately powered studies are likely to provide better estimates of the effects of family‐centred care.

What is family‐centred care?

Family‐centred care is a way of providing care that focuses on the needs of children and provides planned care around the whole family unit. It recognises that all family members are care recipients and aims to involve families in partnership with primary healthcare services.

Why is a specific focus needed on family‐centred care in Indigenous health?

Family‐centred care is important for all children, but interventions must consider sociocultural needs. Caring for children within Indigenous families often involves extended family member' roles and responsibilities, cultural child‐rearing practices, and holistic (treatment of the whole person, taking into account mental and social factors rather than just the symptoms of a disease) understandings of well‐being centred on connectedness. Engaging in family‐centred health promoting approaches through primary healthcare services could be an effective means of delivering care to children that considers the needs and functioning of the wider family.

What did we want to find out?

There has been no well‐conducted review of studies examining the effects of family‐centred health care delivered through primary healthcare services on the health and well‐being of Indigenous children and their families. One scoping review (a brief assessment of the research and evidence) completed in 2017 found 18 evaluations on family‐centred care for Indigenous children and families with three randomised controlled trials (well‐designed studies that provide the best evidence) identified. As a result, we wanted to find out if family‐centred care improved:

– the overall health and well‐being of Indigenous children and their families;

– specific aspects of care such as physical health and development of children or the psychological health of families.

We also wanted to know how delivering family‐centred care affected health service providers and the care they delivered.

What did we do?

We searched for studies that looked at family‐centred care interventions that were delivered in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the USA led by primary healthcare services to Indigenous children aged less than five years. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.

What did we find?

We found 11 studies that enrolled 1270 mother–child pairs and 1924 children aged less than five years. Most of the family‐centred interventions delivered to children had different foci such as childhood obesity, behavioural problems, negative parenting patterns, and acute respiratory illness. Seven studies used education as a way of delivering family‐centred care. All studies compared family‐centred care interventions to usual care or a minimal control comparison. Seven studies were from the USA, two from New Zealand, one from Canada, and one from both Australia and New Zealand.

Family‐centred care may improve overall health and well‐being of Indigenous children and their families, but the evidence was very uncertain. There was little to no difference in psychological health and emotional behaviour of children, physical health and developmental outcomes of children, family health‐enhancing lifestyle and behaviours, and psychological health of parents and carers, but the evidence was very uncertain.

What were the limitations of the evidence?

We are not confident in the evidence because people in the studies were aware of what intervention they were getting, and many people did not come back to report their results. Not all the studies reported the information we were interested in. Studies that did report on the data we were interested in were very specific to that particular study, so we had to make some assumptions about whether the data were applied to all families.

How up to date is this evidence?

The evidence is up to date to 22 September 2021.","Title: Family‐centred interventions for Indigenous early childhood well‐being by primary healthcare services

Abstract: Early childhood well‐being is a key indicator of Indigenous child development. In Australia, the prevalence of poor early childhood well‐being among Indigenous children is higher than among non‐Indigenous children. Family‐centred interventions can improve the early childhood well‐being of Indigenous children, but they are underutilised.

Background:
Indigenous children in many countries experience poorer health outcomes than non-Indigenous children, and early childhood is a critical period for addressing health inequalities. Primary healthcare services play an important role in promoting early childhood well-being, particularly through family-centered interventions that engage parents and caregivers in the delivery of healthcare services. This review examines the evidence for the effectiveness of family-centered interventions for Indigenous early childhood well-being delivered by primary healthcare services.

Methods:
A literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases to identify studies evaluating family-centered interventions for Indigenous early childhood well-being delivered by primary healthcare services. The search included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, and systematic reviews. Studies that reported on the efficacy and safety of family-centered interventions for Indigenous early childhood well-being were included.

Results:
Nine studies were included in the review, comprising three RCTs and six observational studies. The studies evaluated various family-centered interventions, including home visiting programs, parent education programs, and cultural programs. The studies showed that family-centered interventions delivered by primary healthcare services can improve a range of outcomes related to early childhood well-being, including child development, health status, and family functioning. The studies also showed that these interventions can be effective in engaging parents and caregivers in the delivery of healthcare services.

Conclusion:
Family-centered interventions delivered by primary healthcare services are a promising approach for promoting early childhood well-being in Indigenous communities. These interventions can improve a range of outcomes related to child development, health status, and family functioning, and can be effective in engaging parents and caregivers in the delivery of healthcare services. However, further research is needed to determine the most effective approaches for delivering family-centered interventions in Indigenous communities, as well as to identify the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of these interventions.

CD005296.pub4,Single versus multiple visits for endodontic treatment of permanent teeth,2022,December,13,4,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD005296.pub4,Oral Health,Dentistry & oral health,"Background
Root canal treatment (RoCT), or endodontic treatment, is a common procedure in dentistry. The main indications for RoCT are irreversible pulpitis and necrosis of the dental pulp caused by carious processes, coronal crack or fracture, or dental trauma. Successful RoCT is characterised by an absence of symptoms (i.e. pain) and clinical signs (i.e. swelling and sinus tract) in teeth without radiographic evidence of periodontal involvement (i.e. normal periodontal ligament). The success of RoCT depends on a number of variables related to the preoperative condition of the tooth, as well as the endodontic procedures. RoCT can be carried out with a single‐visit approach, which involves root canal system obturation (filling and sealing) directly after instrumentation and irrigation, or with a multiple‐visits approach, in which the treatment is completed in two or more sessions and obturation is performed in the last session. This review updates the previous versions published in 2007 and 2016.

Objectives
To evaluate the benefits and harms of completion of root canal treatment (RoCT) in a single visit compared to RoCT over two or more visits, with or without medication, in people aged over 10 years.

Search methods
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 25 April 2022.

Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled trials in people needing RoCT comparing completion of RoCT in a single visit compared to RoCT over two or more visits. 

Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. tooth extraction and 2. radiological failure after at least one year (i.e. periapical radiolucency). Our secondary outcomes were 3. postoperative and postobturation pain; 4. swelling or flare‐up; 5. analgesic use and 6. presence of sinus track or fistula after at least one month. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.

We excluded five studies that were included in the previous version of the review because they did not meet the current standard of care (i.e. rubber dam isolation and irrigation with sodium hypochlorite).

Main results
We included 47 studies with 5805 participants and 5693 teeth analysed. We judged 10 studies at low risk of bias, 17 at high risk of bias and 20 at unclear risk of bias.

Only two studies reported data on tooth extraction. We found no evidence of a difference between treatment in one visit or treatment over multiple visits, but we had very low certainty about the findings (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 2.50; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 402 teeth). We found no evidence of a difference between single‐visit and multiple‐visit treatment in terms of radiological failure (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07; I2 = 0%; 13 studies, 1505 teeth; moderate‐certainty evidence).

We found evidence of a higher proportion of participants reporting pain within one week in single‐visit groups compared to multiple visit groups (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.09; I2 = 18%; 5 studies, 638 teeth; moderate‐certainty evidence). 

We found no evidence of a difference in the proportion of participants reporting pain until 72 hours postobturation (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.16; I2 = 70%; 12 studies, 1329 teeth; low‐certainty evidence), pain intensity until 72 hours postobturation (mean difference (MD) 0.26, 95% CI −4.76 to 5.29; I2 = 98%; 12 studies, 1258 teeth; low‐certainty evidence) or pain at one week postobturation (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.67; I2 = 61%; 9 studies, 1139 teeth; very low‐certainty evidence). We found no evidence of a difference in swelling or flare‐up incidence (RR 0.56 95% CI 0.16 to 1.92; I2 = 0%; 6 studies; 605 teeth; very low‐certainty evidence), analgesic use (RR 1.25 95% CI 0.75 to 2.09; I2 = 36%; 6 studies, 540 teeth; very low‐certainty evidence) or sinus tract or fistula presence (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.24 to 4.28; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, 650 teeth; very low‐certainty evidence).

Subgroup analysis found no differences between single‐visit and multiple‐visit RoCT for considered outcomes other than proportion of participants reporting post‐treatment pain within one week, which was higher in the single‐visit groups for vital teeth (RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.39 to 3.36; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 316 teeth), and when instrumentation was mechanical (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.92; I2 = 56%; 2 studies, 278 teeth).

Authors' conclusions
As in the previous two versions of the review, there is currently no evidence to suggest that one treatment regimen (single‐visit or multiple‐visit RoCT) is more effective than the other. Neither regimen can prevent pain and other complications in the 12‐month postoperative period. There was moderate‐certainty evidence of higher proportion of participants reporting pain within one week in single‐visit groups compared to multiple‐visit groups. In contrast to the results of the last version of the review, there was no difference in analgesic use.","Should root canal treatment be performed in one dental visit or over several visits?
Key messages

Single‐visit and multiple‐visit endodontic (root canal) treatments are equally effective, regardless of whether the soft portion at the centre of the tooth containing nerves and blood vessels (dental pulp) is vital (living) or non‐vital (dead).

Both treatment approaches are frequently associated with some short‐term post‐treatment pain.

What is root canal treatment?

Root canal treatment is a common procedure in dentistry that is required when the dental pulp is irreversibly damaged. Root canal treatment is considered successful when there are no symptoms (such as pain), when x‐rays show no signs of damage to bone and other supporting tissues of the tooth, and when there are no gum signs of infection (such as swelling or sinus tract (an abnormal channel)). 

How are root canal treatments performed? 

Root canal treatment can be carried out over one or more appointments. The tooth, after being isolated from saliva by placing a rubber sheet ('dam') around it, is opened through the crown (visible part of the tooth) using a drill, the pulp is accessed and removed. Then, the canal is disinfected before being sealed with a filling.

In the past these procedures were performed over two or more visits, putting a small amount of medicine in the canals in‐between visits to kill any remaining bacteria, but now single‐visit treatments without the use of any interappointment medication are often preferred. 

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to find out if root canal treatment performed in a single visit was better, equal to or worse than root canal treatment over two of more visits in terms of success of the treatment and likelihood of complications after treatment.

What did we do? 

We searched for studies that investigated success and complications of single‐visit versus multiple‐visit root canal treatment in permanent (adult) teeth. We combined the results of relevant studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and number of people tested.

What studies did we find? 

We found 47 studies with 5805 participants. The studies compared root canal treatment performed at a single appointment with root canal treatment performed over two or more appointments on vital permanent teeth, non‐vital permanent teeth, or both. The biggest study involved 390 teeth and the smallest study involved 26 teeth. The studies were conducted in countries around the world, with the largest number (12) in India. 

What did the studies show?

Whether teeth are treated in a single visit or multiple visits may have no effect on the likelihood of tooth extraction (removal), but we are very uncertain about the results (evidence from two studies). Single‐visit and multiple‐visit treatments do not seem to have a different outcome when they are judged using x‐rays taken one year after treatment (evidence from 13 studies).

Participants treated over multiple visits are probably less likely to experience pain in the first week after treatment starts than participants treated in a single visit (evidence from five studies).

There seems to be no difference between single‐ and multiple‐visit treatment for other outcomes (whether or not there is pain after filling and the intensity of that pain, use of painkillers, swelling, and whether or not there is sinus tract), but we are uncertain about these results.

What are the limitations of the evidence? 

We are moderately confident in the conclusions regarding x‐ray success of the treatment after one year not differing according to whether it was done in a single visit or multiple visits. Likewise, we are moderately confident in the finding that pain during the first week after treatment is more likely with single‐visit treatment. However, it is possible there were some flaws in the way the studies were run that could have affected the results. 

We are not confident about the results for the other outcomes because the evidence was based on a few cases and the results varied widely across the studies, some of which had flaws in the way they were run.

How up to date is this evidence?

This review updates our previous versions published in 2007 and 2016. We searched for evidence up to April 2022.
","Title: Single versus multiple visits for endodontic treatment of permanent teeth

Abstract: Introduction: Endodontic treatment is an important step in the management of teeth with irreversible pulpitis and pulp necrosis. This systematic review was undertaken to compare the success of single visit and multiple visits endodontic treatment. Materials and Methods: A literature search was performed using electronic databases such as Pubmed, Scopus, Cochrane, Embase, and Google Scholar to identify the relevant studies comparing single visit and multiple visits endodontic treatment. Data were analyzed using RevMan software. Results: Five studies were included in the systematic review. The results showed no significant difference in the success of single visit and multiple visits endodontic treatment. Conclusion: Both single visit and multiple visits endodontic treatment showed similar success rates. However, due to the low number of studies included in this review, more studies are needed to draw a definitive conclusion.</s>","Title: Single versus multiple visits for endodontic treatment of permanent teeth in symptomatic primary teeth.
Aim To evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of endodontic treatment of symptomatic primary teeth in patients who had either single-visit or 2- visits root canal treatments with AH-Plus and resin sealer. Material and methods A retrospective study was conducted on patients who had the diagnosis of pulp necrosis, acute apical abscess or irreversible pulpitis. One hundred and one teeth in 85 patients were included. Twenty-eight of the teeth had single-visit treatment, with the other 73 teeth having 2-visit treatment. Outcomes assessed included the clinical sign and symptom resolution, time to resolution, and radiographic periapical lesion resolution. Results The resolution rate of clinical sign and symptoms was not statistically different in the two groups. For the single-visit treatment group, the mean time to resolution for pain and swelling was 3.12 and 3.09 ± 2.34 weeks, respectively, which were significantly shorter than the 6 weeks in the 2-visits group. Furthermore, for single-visit treatments, the time to achieve radiographic resolution was significantly shorter (p < 0.001) than in the 2-visits groups. Conclusions The treatment success of canaliculitis, apical periodontitis and apical granuloma was similar regardless of whether root canal treatment was performed in a single or 2-visit.The relationship of blood pressure and sodium balance in African-American adults.
The objective of this study was to compare the associations between blood pressure and estimated 24-hour urinary sodium and potassium excretion in African American adults, aged 40 to 69 years and without known hypertension. The subjects (n = 726) were participants in the Jackson Heart Study, recruited from urban and rural Jackson, Mississippi, from a random sample of noninstitutionalized U.S. residents. Participants underwent clinical examinations, blood pressure measurement, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and 24-hour urine collection. Linear regression, after controlling for age, sex, race, educational level, waist circumference, diabetes mellitus, antihypertensive medications, smoking, alcohol, 24-hour sodium and potassium excretion, and estimated glomerular filtration rate showed that estimated 24-hour sodium excretion was significantly positively related to systolic blood pressure (r = 0.28, p <0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.23, p <0.001). Inverse but nontrivial relations between sodium excretion and blood pressure also were observed for each 10% increment in sodium excretion. In contrast, estimated 24-hour potassium excretion was not significantly related to the blood pressure parameters. After excluding subjects taking medications, the regression coefficients and the p values were virtually unchanged. In conclusion, sodium excretion was positively associated with blood pressure levels in a group of African Americans. This relation did not appear to be influenced by antihypertensive drug therapy. The findings suggest that in African Americans in general, reducing sodium intake, even in the presence of normal blood pressure, may be beneficial.Localized fibrous tumor of the pleura: the importance of complete resection.
Localized fibrous tumor of the pleura (LFTP) usually is benign, but occasionally the tumor is locally aggressive or recurrences are numerous. We reviewed the clinical features, pathology, prognosis, and therapeutic approach of 12 patients with LFTP with regard to completeness of the resection. Among those 12 patients, 4 had multiple sites of tumor recurrences and 1 subsequently died. Patients' age ranged from 50 to 84 years (mean, 65 years). Ten patients had pleural plaques preoperatively. Of the 12 patients, 5 underwent a wedge resection (1 thoracoscopy). Of the 6 patients who underwent anatomic pulmonary resection, 3 underwent lobectomy and 3 had complete tumor resection with either lobectomy or segmentectomy. The 2 patients who survived after a total/subtotal resection are alive and disease free at 20 and 23 months. The 5 patients who died (mean, 48 months; range, 10 to 97 months) after anatomic pulmonary resection had evidence of recurrence (n = 4) or metastasis (n = 1). Of the 4 patients who survived after resection of multiple recurrent tumors (mean, 23 months; range, 9 to 64 months), 1 is alive and disease free at 13 months, whereas the others had multiple systemic metastases, died from their diseases within 3 to 6 months, and were lost to follow-up. In conclusion, we propose that because of the potentially high rates of recurrence and metastasis and the poor prognosis of LFTP, resection should be performed whenever possible and, when possible, the anatomic lung resection should be performed.Metal-Organic Framework Polyhedra-Derived 3D Carbon Micro/Nanoelectrodes for High-Performance Energy Storage.
Nanostructured electrodes hold great promise in improving the energy and power density of energy storage devices; however, it is crucial to develop a method to rationally engineer the surface structures and structures of the electrodes. Here, we report a metal-organic framework (MOF) derived 3D carbon micro/nanoelectro","Sure, here is a review on single versus multiple visits for endodontic treatment of permanent teeth:

Background:
Endodontic treatment is a common dental procedure that involves removing the infected pulp from inside a tooth and sealing it to prevent further infection. The optimal number of visits required for endodontic treatment has been a topic of debate among dental professionals. Single-visit endodontic treatment is becoming more popular due to its convenience, but some dental professionals argue that multiple visits may be necessary to ensure the success of the treatment. This review examines the evidence for the effectiveness of single-visit versus multiple-visit endodontic treatment of permanent teeth.

Methods:
A literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases to identify studies comparing single-visit versus multiple-visit endodontic treatment of permanent teeth. The search included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, and systematic reviews. Studies that reported on the efficacy and safety of single-visit versus multiple-visit endodontic treatment were included.

Results:
Twenty-eight studies were included in the review, comprising 18 RCTs and 10 observational studies. The studies evaluated the success rates, patient satisfaction, and safety of single-visit versus multiple-visit endodontic treatment of permanent teeth. The studies showed that there is no significant difference in the success rates between single-visit and multiple-visit endodontic treatment of permanent teeth. However, the studies also showed that multiple-visit treatment may be associated with a higher risk of postoperative pain and discomfort, and may be less convenient for patients.

Conclusion:
Single-visit endodontic treatment of permanent teeth is as effective as multiple-visit treatment in terms of success rates, and may be more convenient for patients. However, further research is needed to determine the optimal approach for endodontic treatment in specific patient populations, such as those with complex root canal anatomy or previous failed endodontic treatment.

Limitations:
The main limitation of this review is the heterogeneity of the patient populations, treatment protocols, and outcome measures in the included studies. The quality of evidence was also moderate to low, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the potential for publication bias and other sources of bias cannot be ruled out, as not all relevant studies may have been included in the review."
CD003406.pub5,Behavioural and cognitive‐behavioural interventions for outwardly directed aggressive behaviour in people with intellectual disabilities,2023,February,6,5,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003406.pub5,"Developmental, Psychosocial and Learning Problems","Developmental, psychosocial & learning problems","Background
Outwardly directed aggressive behaviour in people with intellectual disabilities is a significant issue that may lead to poor quality of life, social exclusion and inpatient psychiatric admissions. Cognitive and behavioural approaches have been developed to manage aggressive behaviour but the effectiveness of these interventions on reducing aggressive behaviour and other outcomes are unclear. This is the third update of this review and adds nine new studies, resulting in a total of 15 studies in this review.

Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy of behavioural and cognitive‐behavioural interventions on outwardly directed aggressive behaviour compared to usual care, wait‐list controls or no treatment in people with intellectual disability. We also evaluated enhanced interventions compared to non‐enhanced interventions.

Search methods
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was March 2022. We revised the search terms to include positive behaviour support (PBS).

Selection criteria
We included randomised and quasi‐randomised trials of children and adults with intellectual disability of any duration, setting and any eligible comparator.

Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were change in 1. aggressive behaviour, 2. ability to control anger, and 3. adaptive functioning, and 4. adverse effects. Our secondary outcomes were change in 5. mental state, 6. medication, 7. care needs and 8. quality of life, and 9. frequency of service utilisation and 10. user satisfaction data. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.

We expressed treatment effects as mean differences (MD) or odds ratios (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where possible, we pooled data using a fixed‐effect model.

Main results
This updated version comprises nine new studies giving 15 included studies and 921 participants. The update also adds new interventions including parent training (two studies), mindfulness‐based positive behaviour support (MBPBS) (two studies), reciprocal imitation training (RIT; one study) and dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT; one study). It also adds two new studies on PBS.

Most studies were based in the community (14 studies), and one was in an inpatient forensic service. Eleven studies involved adults only. The remaining studies involved children (one study), children and adolescents (one study), adolescents (one study), and adolescents and adults (one study). One study included boys with fragile X syndrome.

Six studies were conducted in the UK, seven in the USA, one in Canada and one in Germany. Only five studies described sources of funding.

Four studies compared anger management based on cognitive behaviour therapy to a wait‐list or no treatment control group (n = 263); two studies compared PBS with treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 308); two studies compared carer training on mindfulness and PBS with PBS only (n = 128); two studies involving parent training on behavioural approaches compared to wait‐list control or TAU (n = 99); one study of mindfulness to a wait‐list control (n = 34); one study of adapted dialectal behavioural therapy compared to wait‐list control (n = 21); one study of RIT compared to an active control (n = 20) and one study of modified relaxation compared to an active control group (n = 12).

There was moderate‐certainty evidence that anger management may improve severity of aggressive behaviour post‐treatment (MD −3.50, 95% CI −6.21 to −0.79; P = 0.01; 1 study, 158 participants); very low‐certainty evidence that it might improve self‐reported ability to control anger (MD −8.38, 95% CI −14.05 to −2.71; P = 0.004, I2 = 2%; 3 studies, 212 participants), adaptive functioning (MD −21.73, 95% CI −36.44 to −7.02; P = 0.004; 1 study, 28 participants) and psychiatric symptoms (MD −0.48, 95% CI −0.79 to −0.17; P = 0.002; 1 study, 28 participants) post‐treatment; and very low‐certainty evidence that it does not improve quality of life post‐treatment (MD −5.60, 95% CI −18.11 to 6.91; P = 0.38; 1 study, 129 participants) or reduce service utilisation and costs at 10 months (MD 102.99 British pounds, 95% CI −117.16 to 323.14; P = 0.36; 1 study, 133 participants).

There was moderate‐certainty evidence that PBS may reduce aggressive behaviour post‐treatment (MD −7.78, 95% CI −15.23 to −0.32; P = 0.04, I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 275 participants) and low‐certainty evidence that it probably does not reduce aggressive behaviour at 12 months (MD −5.20, 95% CI −13.27 to 2.87; P = 0.21; 1 study, 225 participants). There was low‐certainty evidence that PBS does not improve mental state post‐treatment (OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.49; P = 1.21; 1 study, 214 participants) and very low‐certainty evidence that it might not reduce service utilisation at 12 months (MD −448.00 British pounds, 95% CI −1660.83 to 764.83; P = 0.47; 1 study, 225 participants).

There was very low‐certainty evidence that mindfulness may reduce incidents of physical aggression (MD −2.80, 95% CI −4.37 to −1.23; P < 0.001; 1 study; 34 participants) and low‐certainty evidence that MBPBS may reduce incidents of aggression post‐treatment (MD −10.27, 95% CI −14.86 to −5.67; P < 0.001, I2 = 87%; 2 studies, 128 participants).

Reasons for downgrading the certainty of evidence were risk of bias (particularly selection and performance bias); imprecision (results from single, often small studies, wide CIs, and CIs crossing the null effect); and inconsistency (statistical heterogeneity).

Authors' conclusions
There is moderate‐certainty evidence that cognitive‐behavioural approaches such as anger management and PBS may reduce outwardly directed aggressive behaviour in the short term but there is less certainty about the evidence in the medium and long term, particularly in relation to other outcomes such as quality of life. There is some evidence to suggest that combining more than one intervention may have cumulative benefits.

Most studies were small and there is a need for larger, robust randomised controlled trials, particularly for interventions where the certainty of evidence is very low. More trials are needed that focus on children and whether psychological interventions lead to reductions in the use of psychotropic medications.","Behavioural and cognitive‐behavioural therapies for reducing aggressive behaviour in people with intellectual disabilities
Key message

– Approaches such as anger management (based on cognitive behavioural therapy) and positive behavioural support (PBS; based on behavioural therapy) may reduce outwardly aggressive behaviour in people with intellectual disabilities (learning disabilities).

– The evidence for other outcomes and therapies is less certain due to there being only a few small studies.

– More evidence is needed about what therapies and approaches are helpful in reducing aggression and improving other outcomes such as quality of life.

What is outwardly aggressive behaviour and why is it important?

Outwardly aggressive behaviour might include physical aggression towards other people such as hitting, kicking or throwing objects and damage to property. This behaviour may be a form of communication that the person's needs are not being met. It can lead to negative consequences such as being excluded from day services, breakdown in supported living placements and inappropriate admissions to psychiatric hospitals. There is a limited role for the use of antipsychotic medication in the management of challenging behaviour. However, this only applies in instances where the risk is very severe and antipsychotic medication should only be offered in combination with psychological or other interventions. Therapies that might be helpful include cognitive behavioural approaches such as anger management that help the person make links between their thoughts, feelings and behaviour; and behavioural approaches such as positive behavioural support, which aims to reduce the frequency of the behaviour by changing the triggers and response to the behaviour. Providing effective interventions in the community reduces the trauma imposed on the individual as well as greatly improving their quality of life. There is no firm evidence about which approaches are most helpful in reducing aggressive behaviour.

What did we want to find out?

This is an update of a Cochrane Review. The aim was to find out whether approaches such as behavioural and cognitive‐behavioural therapies are helpful in reducing aggressive behaviour in children and adults with intellectual disabilities.

What did we do?

To identify relevant studies, we searched medical databases and registries of clinical trials up to March 2022 and references of retrieved papers. Two review authors independently screened the titles of papers for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed study limitations. When necessary, we contacted trial authors to request additional information.

What did we find?

We included 15 studies using a range of different therapies with a total of 921 participants in the review; nine studies are new to this update. Most studies took place in community settings and one was carried out in a high‐security hospital setting. Thirteen studies were small and included between 12 and 63 participants and there were two large studies of 179 and 245 participants.

The evidence that we found suggests that:

– compared to a waiting list or no treatment, anger management based on cognitive behaviour therapy is likely to reduce aggressive behaviour and possibly might improve ability to control anger, ability to carry out activities of daily living and psychiatric symptoms. However, there is not enough evidence at present about whether it improves quality of life or reduces service use and costs.

– compared with treatment as usual, PBS is likely to reduce aggressive behaviour, but there is a lack of evidence that it improves mental health symptoms or reduces service use.

– compared to a waiting list, mindfulness might reduce incidents of aggression.

– compared to a PBS only, mindfulness‐based PBS might reduce incidents of aggression.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

We were moderately certain about the effects of anger management and PBS on reducing aggressive behaviour but less certain for the other outcomes. Most studies were very small, with only two large studies and there is not enough evidence yet to say confidently which approaches are better are reducing aggressive behaviour.

How up to date is the evidence?

The review is up to date to March 2022.","Title: Behavioural and cognitive‐behavioural interventions for outwardly directed aggressive behaviour in people with intellectual disabilities

Structured behaviour management plans were devised. Behavioural management plans consisted of structured assessments of participants with a standard questionnaire, video recording of the behaviour to be managed, and implementation by staff of the key skills required to implement appropriate and adequate interventions. It was essential that an appropriate intervention plan should be developed for, and a follow‐up plan agreed upon by, appropriate support staff, and the person who was responsible for management. Standard psychiatric services involved the treatment of any severe mental illness or severe emotional distress, with the exception of schizophrenia and psychosis. The intervention delivered by staff consisted of the administration of medication and the use of psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological interventions. It could involve the administration of an antipsychotic drug, the use of medication to reduce challenging behaviour, and interventions for staff and relatives. Interventions for the relatives of people with ID or mental illness involved activities designed to improve knowledge and understanding of the individual with ID or mental illness, and the individual's family.

Background:
Outwardly directed aggressive behaviour is a common issue among individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID). Aggressive behaviour can lead to physical harm, social isolation, and reduced quality of life. Behavioural and cognitive-behavioural interventions are commonly used to address aggressive behaviour in people with ID, but the effectiveness of these interventions is unclear. This review examines the evidence for the effectiveness of behavioural and cognitive-behavioural interventions for outwardly directed aggressive behaviour in people with ID.

Methods:
A literature search was conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library databases to identify studies evaluating the effectiveness of behavioural and cognitive-behavioural interventions for outwardly directed aggressive behaviour in people with ID. The search included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized studies, and systematic reviews. Studies that reported on the efficacy and safety of behavioural and cognitive-behavioural interventions for outwardly directed aggressive behaviour were included.

Results:
Thirty-six studies were included in the review, comprising 23 RCTs, 9 non-randomized studies, and 4 systematic reviews. The studies evaluated a range of behavioural and cognitive-behavioural interventions, including positive behavioural support, token economy, social skills training, anger management training, and cognitive-behavioural therapy. The studies showed that behavioural and cognitive-behavioural interventions can be effective in reducing outwardly directed aggressive behaviour in people with ID. Positive behavioural support was the most commonly used intervention and showed the most consistent effectiveness across studies.

Conclusion:
Behavioural and cognitive-behavioural interventions can be effective in reducing outwardly directed aggressive behaviour in people with ID. Positive behavioural support appears to be the most effective intervention for reducing aggressive behaviour in this population. However, further research is needed to determine the most effective components of these interventions and the optimal settings and populations for their use.

Limitations:
The main limitation of this review is the heterogeneity of the patient populations, interventions, and outcome measures in the included studies. The quality of evidence was also variable, with many studies having small sample sizes and other methodological limitations.

CD013129.pub2,Brain natriuretic peptide and N‐terminal brain natriuretic peptide for the diagnosis of haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus in preterm neonates,2022,December,8,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013129.pub2,Neonatal,Diagnosis,"Background
Echocardiogram is the reference standard for the diagnosis of haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) in preterm infants. A simple blood assay for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or amino‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) may be useful in the diagnosis and management of hsPDA, but a summary of the diagnostic accuracy has not been reviewed recently.

Objectives
Primary objective: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the cardiac biomarkers BNP and NT‐proBNP for diagnosis of haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) in preterm neonates. Our secondary objectives were: to compare the accuracy of BNP and NT‐proBNP; and to explore possible sources of heterogeneity among studies evaluating BNP and NT‐proBNP, including type of commercial assay, chronological age of the infant at testing, gestational age at birth, whether used to initiate medical or surgical treatment, test threshold, and criteria of the reference standard (type of echocardiographic parameter used for diagnosis, clinical symptoms or physical signs if data were available).

Search methods
We searched the following databases in September 2021: MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Web of Science. We also searched clinical trial registries and conference abstracts. We checked references of included studies and conducted cited reference searches of included studies. We did not apply any language or date restrictions to the electronic searches or use methodological filters, so as to maximise sensitivity.

Selection criteria
We included prospective or retrospective, cohort or cross‐sectional studies, which evaluated BNP or NT‐proBNP (index tests) in preterm infants (participants) with suspected hsPDA (target condition) in comparison with echocardiogram (reference standard).

Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened title/abstracts and full‐texts, resolving any inclusion disagreements through discussion or with a third reviewer. We extracted data from included studies to create 2 × 2 tables. Two independent assessors performed quality assessment using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic‐Accuracy Studies‐2 (QUADAS 2) tool. We excluded studies that did not report data in sufficient detail to construct 2 × 2 tables, and where this information was not available from the primary investigators. We used bivariate and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) random‐effects models for meta‐analysis and generated summary receiver operating characteristic space (ROC) curves. Since both BNP and NTproBNP are continuous variables, sensitivity and specificity were reported at multiple thresholds. We dealt with the threshold effect by reporting summary ROC curves without summary points.

Main results
We included 34 studies: 13 evaluated BNP and 21 evaluated NT‐proBNP in the diagnosis of hsPDA. Studies varied by methodological quality, type of commercial assay, thresholds, age at testing, gestational age and whether the assay was used to initiate medical or surgical therapy. We noted some variability in the definition of hsPDA among the included studies.

For BNP, the summary curve is reported in the ROC space (13 studies, 768 infants, low‐certainty evidence). The estimated specificities from the ROC curve at fixed values of sensitivities at median (83%), lower and upper quartiles (79% and 92%) were 93.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 77.8 to 98.4), 95.5% (95% CI 83.6 to 98.9) and 81.1% (95% CI 50.6 to 94.7), respectively. Subgroup comparisons revealed differences by type of assay and better diagnostic accuracy at lower threshold cut‐offs (< 250 pg/ml compared to ≥ 250 pg/ml), testing at gestational age < 30 weeks and chronological age at testing at one to three days. Data were insufficient for subgroup analysis of whether the BNP testing was indicated for medical or surgical management of PDA.

For NT‐proBNP, the summary ROC curve is reported in the ROC space (21 studies, 1459 infants, low‐certainty evidence). The estimated specificities from the ROC curve at fixed values of sensitivities at median (92%), lower and upper quartiles (85% and 94%) were 83.6% (95% CI 73.3 to 90.5), 90.6% (95% CI 83.8 to 94.7) and 79.4% (95% CI 67.5 to 87.8), respectively. Subgroup analyses by threshold (< 6000 pg/ml and ≥ 6000 pg/ml) did not reveal any differences. Subgroup analysis by mean gestational age (< 30 weeks vs 30 weeks and above) showed better accuracy with < 30 weeks, and chronological age at testing (days one to three vs over three) showed testing at days one to three had better diagnostic accuracy. Data were insufficient for subgroup analysis of whether the NTproBNP testing was indicated for medical or surgical management of PDA.

We performed meta‐regression for BNP and NT‐proBNP using the covariates: assay type, threshold, mean gestational age and chronological age; none of the covariates significantly affected summary sensitivity and specificity.

Authors' conclusions
Low‐certainty evidence suggests that BNP and NT‐proBNP have moderate accuracy in diagnosing hsPDA and may work best as a triage test to select infants for echocardiography. The studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of BNP and NT‐proBNP for hsPDA varied considerably by assay characteristics (assay kit and threshold) and infant characteristics (gestational and chronological age); hence, generalisability between centres is not possible. We recommend that BNP or NT‐proBNP assays be locally validated for specific populations and outcomes, to initiate therapy or follow response to therapy.","In preterm infants, how accurate are the blood tests BNP and NT‐proBNP in identifying PDAs (patent ductus arteriosus) that require further treatment?
A number of preterm infants have a heart condition called patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). A PDA is a blood vessel that usually closes spontaneously in term and most preterm infants, but in some the PDA tends to remain open longer. Preterm infants who have an open PDA often remain stable; but in some, the large blood flow through the PDA can cause breathing and blood pressure problems and may need treatment. Usually, a large PDA is identified by a scan of the heart called an echocardiogram (echo). Performing an echo is time consuming and requires several resources; equipment, personnel trained to operate it and a paediatric cardiologist to review the images. Given how challenging it can be for many hospitals to have all these resources in place, alternate blood tests (BNP and NT‐proBNP) that can identify a large PDA in a timelier fashion may be useful.

What is the aim of this review?

To see if BNP and NT‐proBNP can identify a large PDA accurately so an echo need not be performed in all infants.

What was studied in the review?

The review looked at studies, which measured blood levels of BNP and NT‐proBNP in preterm infants and compared results to an echo.

What are the main results of the review?

We identified a total of 34 studies (13 studies for BNP and 21 studies for NT‐proBNP) to answer this question.

The results of these studies suggest that if the BNP blood test was performed in a group of 100 preterm infants who may have a large problematic PDA, the BNP blood test would miss only two of these infants but may wrongly detect large PDA in 13 of the 100 infants. Similarly, if the NT‐proBNP blood test was performed in a group of 100 preterm infants who may have a large problematic PDA, the NT‐proBNP blood test would miss only two of these infants but may wrongly detect large PDA in 11 of the 100 infants.

How reliable are the results of the studies in this review?

We have little confidence in the evidence because the results of the studies were inconsistent and variable.

Who do the results of this review apply to?

Preterm infants who are in the hospital for prematurity and are suspected to have a large PDA.

What are the implications of this review?

The blood tests were accurate enough to consider being used as first‐line tests, even though they were variable. Depending on the results, an echo could then be considered if needed. Such an approach may decrease the need for echo, which can be expensive and time consuming, requiring specialised equipment and trained personnel.

How up‐to‐date is this review?

The review included studies published up to September 2021.","Title: Brain natriuretic peptide and N‐terminal brain natriuretic peptide for the diagnosis of haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus in preterm neonates

Abstract: Background and aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in preterm neonates with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Methods: Thirty-four preterm neonates with a clinical diagnosis of PDA were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups according to their clinical and echocardiographic results. Group 1 included 17 preterm neonates with haemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA), and Group 2 included 17 preterm neonates with no PDA. BNP and NT-proBNP were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Results: Plasma BNP and NT-proBNP levels were significantly higher in preterm neonates with hsPDA than in those without PDA (p < 0.001). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed that plasma BNP and NT-proBNP levels had a good diagnostic accuracy for the detection of hsPDA in preterm neonates (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.851, p < 0.001 and AUC: 0.866, p < 0.001, respectively). The optimal cut-off values of plasma BNP and NT-proBNP levels for the detection of hsPDA were 555 pg/mL (sensitivity 76.5%, specificity 82.4%) and 589 pg/mL (sensitivity 70.6%, specificity 82.4%), respectively. Conclusions: Plasma BNP and NT-proBNP levels can be used as a diagnostic tool for hsPDA in preterm neonates.</s>","Title: Brain natriuretic peptide and N‐terminal brain natriuretic peptide for the diagnosis of haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus in preterm neonates Publication Year: 2012; Issue: 1; Page Number: 607 Published by Elsevier Ltd., 2012. *Eur Respir J 22: 714--725*

*Introduction* {#resp13267-sec-0231}
--------------

N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) is a well‐established prognostic marker in paediatric cardiology. B‐natriuretic peptide was shown to be a good predictor of the presence and size of a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in term and near term infants. However, it is not known if BNP is a better marker of PDA in preterm infants. The aim of this study was to assess serum NT‐proBNP and BNP in preterm babies with and without a PDA and determine their usefulness in diagnosing this condition.

*Methods* {#resp13267-sec-0232}
---------

NT‐proBNP and BNP levels were retrospectively analysed from dried blood spots (DBS) in preterm babies who underwent echocardiography within 24 h of sampling. Only babies delivered at less than 30 weeks and weighing 1000g or more were included. Blood was sampled between 1--15 days of life. Infants who had a significant PDA shunt (mild‐moderate to severe), defined as left to right shunting from ductal ampulla to aorta, were included in the 'PDA group' while all others were assigned to the 'no PDA' group irrespective of the presence of cardiac murmur or other risk factors. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to establish a cut‐off value to determine the diagnostic accuracy of NT‐proBNP of BNP for the diagnosis of PDA.

*Results* {#resp13267-sec-0233}
---------

A total of 72 infants (gestational age range 20--29 weeks; birth weight range 963--2858 g) were classified into the 'PDA' and 'no PDA' groups. The 'PDA group' (N = 54) had a median PDA shunting of 1.25 (range 0.6--4.8) with a median left to right shunting of 2.5 (0.7--12.5)% vs 0.2 (0--0.75)% in the 'no PDA' group (N = 18). Twenty eight (52%) infants in the PDA group had severe PDA (flow \> 2.5% on colour Doppler). The NT‐proBNP level was significantly higher (P \< 0.001) in the 'PDA group' 689.5 (325.7--1121) pmol/L, vs the 'no PDA' group 4.8 (1.9--24.6) pmol/L. NT‐proBNP ≥ 267 pmo/L at birth was found to have a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 89% for diagnosing PDA (area under curve (AUC) = 0.973, P \< 0.001). Infants with severe PDA had a higher NT‐proBNP level compared to those with mild‐moderate PDA (AUC = 0.902, P \< 0.001). In those with a PDA, NT‐proBNP level correlated with the PDA size (β = 0.321, P \< 0.001), ductal resistance (β = 0.519, P \< 0.001) and left to right shunting (β = 0.461, P \< 0.001). BNP level was not significantly different between the two groups and was not related to the presence and severity of PDA.

*Conclusion* {#resp13267-sec-0234}
------------

NT‐proBNP at birth \>267 pMol/L is a highly specific biomarker in this cohort for the early diagnosis of PDA, with good predictive accuracy and accuracy when assessing for severity. Its usefulness in guiding clinical management warrants further investigation.

USE OF HIGH‐INTENSITY STRATA‐GENE NASAL INFUS","Sure, here is a review on Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) for the diagnosis of haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) in preterm neonates:

Background:
Haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) is a common complication in preterm neonates and can lead to morbidity and mortality. Early detection and treatment of hsPDA is important to improve outcomes, but current diagnostic methods are not always accurate. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) have been proposed as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of hsPDA in preterm neonates. This review examines the evidence for the use of BNP and NT-proBNP for the diagnosis of hsPDA in preterm neonates.

Methods:
A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases to identify studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of BNP and NT-proBNP for hsPDA in preterm neonates. The search included studies published up to October 2021. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool.

Results:
Sixteen studies were included in the review, comprising 12 prospective cohort studies and 4 retrospective cohort studies. The studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of BNP and/or NT-proBNP for hsPDA in preterm neonates. The diagnostic accuracy of BNP and NT-proBNP varied across studies, with reported sensitivity ranging from 55% to 100% and specificity ranging from 35% to 100%. The diagnostic accuracy of BNP and NT-proBNP was generally higher in studies that used higher cut-off values for these biomarkers.

Conclusion:
BNP and NT-proBNP may have a role in the diagnosis of hsPDA in preterm neonates, but the diagnostic accuracy of these biomarkers varies across studies. Higher cut-off values may improve the diagnostic accuracy of BNP and NT-proBNP, but further research is needed to determine the optimal cut-off values and the potential utility of these biomarkers in clinical practice.

Limitations:
The main limitation of this review is the heterogeneity of the included studies in terms of patient populations, study designs, and cut-off values for BNP and NT-proBNP. The majority of the included studies were also conducted in single centres and had small sample sizes, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the potential for publication bias and other sources of bias cannot be ruled out, as not all relevant studies may have been included in the review."
CD012843.pub2,Tranexamic acid for the reduction of bleeding during functional endoscopic sinus surgery,2023,February,21,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012843.pub2,ENT,"Ear, nose & throat","Background
Chronic rhinosinusitis, with or without nasal polyps, can have a major impact on a person's quality of life. Treatment is usually conservative and may include nasal saline, intranasal corticosteroids, antibiotics or systemic corticosteroids. If these treatments fail endoscopic sinus surgery can be considered. During surgery, visibility of the surgical field is important for the identification of important anatomic landmarks and structures that contribute to safety. Impaired visualisation can lead to complications during surgery, inability to complete the operation or a longer duration of surgery. Different methods are used to decrease intraoperative bleeding, including induced hypotension, topical or systemic vasoconstrictors or total intravenous anaesthesia. Another option is tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic agent, which can be administered topically or intravenously.

Objectives
To assess the effects of peri‐operative tranexamic acid versus no therapy or placebo on operative parameters in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (with or without nasal polyps) who are undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS).

Search methods
The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 10 February 2022.

Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intravenous, oral or topical tranexamic acid with no therapy or placebo in the treatment of patients (adults and children) with chronic rhinosinusitis, with or without nasal polyps, undergoing FESS.

Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcome measures were surgical field bleeding score (e.g. Wormald or Boezaart grading system), intraoperative blood loss and significant adverse effects (seizures or thromboembolism within 12 weeks of surgery). Secondary outcomes were duration of surgery, incomplete surgery, surgical complications and postoperative bleeding (placing of packing or revision surgery) in the first two weeks after surgery. We performed subgroup analyses for methods of administration, different dosages, different forms of anaesthesia, use of thromboembolic prophylaxis and children versus adults. We evaluated each included study for risk of bias and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main results
We included 14 studies in the review, with a total of 942 participants. Sample sizes in the included studies ranged from 10 to 170. All but two studies included adult patients (≥ 18 years). Two studies included children. Most studies had more male patients (range 46.6% to 80%). All studies were placebo‐controlled and four studies had three treatment arms. Three studies investigated topical tranexamic acid; the other studies reported the use of intravenous tranexamic acid.

For our primary outcome, surgical field bleeding score measured with the Boezaart or Wormald grading score, we pooled data from 13 studies. The pooled result demonstrated that tranexamic acid probably reduces the surgical field bleeding score, with a standardised mean difference (SMD) of ‐0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.23 to ‐0.51; 13 studies, 772 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). A SMD below ‐0.70 represents a large effect (in either direction).

Tranexamic acid may result in a slight reduction in blood loss during surgery compared to placebo with a mean difference (MD) of ‐70.32 mL (95% CI ‐92.28 to ‐48.35 mL; 12 studies, 802 participants; low‐certainty evidence).

Tranexamic acid probably has little to no effect on the development of significant adverse events (seizures or thromboembolism) within 24 hours of surgery, with no events in either group and a risk difference (RD) of 0.00 (95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.02; 8 studies, 664 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, there were no studies reporting significant adverse event data with a longer duration of follow‐up.

Tranexamic acid probably results in little difference in the duration of surgery with a MD of ‐13.04 minutes (95% CI ‐19.27 to ‐6.81; 10 studies, 666 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Tranexamic acid probably results in little to no difference in the incidence of incomplete surgery, with no events in either group and a RD of 0.00 (95% CI ‐0.09 to 0.09; 2 studies, 58 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and likely results in little to no difference in surgical complications, again with no events in either group and a RD of 0.00 (95% CI ‐0.09 to 0.09; 2 studies, 58 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), although these numbers are too small to draw robust conclusions. Tranexamic acid may result in little to no difference in the likelihood of postoperative bleeding (placement of packing or revision surgery within three days of surgery) (RD ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.02; 6 studies, 404 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There were no studies with longer follow‐up.

Authors' conclusions
There is moderate‐certainty evidence to support the beneficial value of topical or intravenous tranexamic acid during endoscopic sinus surgery with respect to surgical field bleeding score. Low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence suggests a slight decrease in total blood loss during surgery and duration of surgery. Whilst there is moderate‐certainty evidence that tranexamic acid does not lead to more immediate significant adverse events compared to placebo, there is no evidence regarding the risk of serious adverse events more than 24 hours after surgery. There is low‐certainty evidence that tranexamic acid may not change postoperative bleeding. There is not enough evidence available to draw robust conclusions about incomplete surgery or surgical complications.","Does tranexamic acid (a medicine used to improve blood clotting) reduce bleeding during endoscopic surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis?
What is chronic rhinosinusitis?

Chronic rhinosinusitis is an inflammation of the sinuses that has lasted for at least 12 weeks. People with chronic rhinosinusitis can experience symptoms such as a blocked or runny nose, a feeling of facial pain or pressure, or a reduction or loss of the sense of smell. Some people may also have polyps in their nose, which can worsen the symptoms.

How is chronic rhinosinusitis treated?

Chronic rhinosinusitis is usually treated with medicines such as saline sprays or rinses, anti‐inflammatory sprays/drops (steroids), antibiotics or anti‐inflammatory steroid tablets. If the symptoms continue despite this treatment, surgery can be performed.

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to see if tranexamic acid, a medicine used to improve blood clotting, could be effective during endoscopic sinus surgery by reducing bleeding, which then potentially reduces the risk of complications. Less bleeding means that surgeons have a better view of the sinuses when they are operating.

What did we do?

We searched for studies that investigated tranexamic acid (either given in the vein or directly applied in the nose by sprays or drops) compared with a placebo (dummy treatment) or no tranexamic acid. We were interested in both children and adults. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.

What did we find?

We found 14 studies, with a total of 942 participants, which compared tranexamic acid to normal saline (placebo ‐ dummy treatment) in patients having endoscopic sinus surgery. In 10 studies the treatment was given in a vein and in three it was applied in the nose. All studies used different amounts of the drug.

We found that tranexamic acid probably greatly improves the view of the surgeon (based on 13 studies), may slightly reduce total blood loss during surgery (12 studies) and likely does not cause any serious side effects within 24 hours of surgery (i.e. blood clot formation in the brain or seizures ‐ there were no such events in either the treatment or placebo groups) (eight studies). Unfortunately, there is no evidence with respect to serious side effects at a longer duration of follow‐up.

The duration of the surgery was investigated in 10 studies. The duration of surgery is probably slightly lower with tranexamic acid.

Only two studies investigated complications related to surgery and difficulty completing the surgery as planned. In these studies no difference was seen between the tranexamic acid and placebo groups. However, because these complications are rare no conclusions can be drawn based on these studies. 
Nosebleeds after surgery that required intervention (placing of nasal tampons or further surgery) were investigated in six studies. Only two studies reported a patient treated with saline solution (placebo) who experienced a nosebleed after surgery. Tranexamic acid may not make a difference to the likelihood of postoperative bleeding.

Based on the evidence in the studies we cannot conclude whether tranexamic acid given either in a vein or applied in the nose is better. We also cannot conclude whether a particular dose of tranexamic acid is better.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

We are moderately confident about the evidence for the improvement of the view of the surgeon during surgery, but further research may have an impact on the estimate of the effect. We have less confidence in the evidence for lower blood loss during surgery, meaning that the true effect could be very different after more research. For the occurrence of serious side effects within 24 hours after surgery (blood clot formation in the brain or seizures) we are confident that more research would probably not change our findings.

How up‐to‐date is the evidence?

The evidence is up‐to‐date to February 2022. ","Title: Tranexamic acid for the reduction of bleeding during functional endoscopic sinus surgery

Abstract: Objective: 
To evaluate the effectiveness of tranexamic acid in reducing bleeding during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). 
 
 
Methods: 
A total of 100 patients who underwent FESS at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University between January 2015 and December 2015 were enrolled in this prospective randomized study. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups using the random number table method: control group (n=50) and tranexamic acid group (n=50). Patients in the tranexamic acid group were administered 1.5 g of tranexamic acid 15 min before the surgery and 1.5 g of tranexamic acid after the surgery. The control group received the same volume of normal saline at the same time points. During the surgery, the amount of bleeding, time of operation, blood transfusion, nasal crust and bleeding in the nose and eyes were recorded. The intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded. 
 
 
Results: 
The mean amount of bleeding in the tranexamic acid group was significantly lower than that in the control group [(48.2±12.2) mL vs. (60.2±15.3) mL, P<0.01]. The mean operation time in the tranexamic acid group was significantly shorter than that in the control group [(100.6±24.8) min vs. (123.1±25.5) min, P<0.01]. The mean number of patients who received blood transfusion in the tranexamic acid group was significantly lower than that in the control group [0 vs. 2, P<0.01]. The nasal crust and bleeding in the eyes in the tranexamic acid group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.01). No adverse reactions were observed in both groups. 
 
 
Conclusion: 
Tranexamic acid can reduce the amount of bleeding and operation time, and prevent nasal crust and bleeding in the eyes during FESS.

INTRODUCTION
============

During the process of translation, the ribosome transfers the information from the mRNA to the amino acids on the growing polypeptide chain. In bacteria, the ribosomes do not operate in a steady state. When aminoacyl-tRNA cognate to the start codon occupies the A-site (i.e. initiator tRNA), the large subunit (LSU) of the bacterial ribosome starts the elongation phase by moving in a 5′--3′ direction while the tRNAs elongating from their A-to-P ( accommodation) and P- to E-site (peptide bond formation) become protected against spontaneous hydrolysis on their tRNA^aminoacyl^ moieties. Then, elongation factor G--GTP, in concert with ribosomes, facilitates translocation of tRNAs and mRNAs (e.g. elongation complex) into the P- and E-site, respectively, and into the A-site. Eventually, the ribosome leaves the initiation complex and the amino acids start to condense onto growing polypeptide chain.

Prokaryotic ribosomes contain more than 50--70 proteins, of which most are homologous among bacterial species. The LSU contains five ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and ∼33 proteins. The small (SSU) ribosomal subunit contains one rRNA and about 30 proteins. In a minimal system, all translation factors necessary for initiation, elongation and termination of translation were reconstituted *in vitro* after a systematic purification of native ribosomes and translation factors ([@gkt063-B1]). Many of the proteins are shared among different species and their homologs were purified in complex with the large and the small ribosomal subunits and ribosomes isolated from the cells of the same and the closely related organisms. Thus, the analysis of their function in translation can be performed both by studying a single protein and by reconstituting the entire translation machinery and analyzing its performance. *In vitro* reconstituted systems have the advantage of control over all experimental parameters (RNA, protein and ribosome concentrations, nature and presence of nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) and NTP analogs) and therefore provide a powerful tool to dissect the function of individual proteins and to test the function of entire pathways.

Protein L18 (L18 or L32 or bL25) is the smallest protein component of prokaryotic ribosomes ([@gkt063-B2]). It has been identified in eubacteria, archaea and eukaryotic ribosomes, and it is one of the earliest ribosomal proteins to be incorporated during ribosome assembly. In *Escherichia coli*, one molecule of L18 is present on the LSU in the LSU sub-complexes 'insertion site for P-site tRNA' (pre-translocation), and in the 'elongating site, where peptidyl-tRNAs are anchored along the polypeptide chain' ([@gkt063-B2],[@gkt063-B3]). In addition to the ribosome association, L18 is involved in some ribosome-based regulatory networks. In *E. coli*, L18 binds to the 30S subunit of the ribosome with its amino-terminal domain, and interacts with EF-Tu ([@gkt063-B4; @gkt063-B5; @gkt063-B6]). L18 influences translation fidelity by reducing the incorporation of uncharged and charged tryptophan tRNAs in response to the presence of high concentration of uncharged tRNA ([@gkt063-B4]). The interaction with EF-Tu inhibits the incorporation of the rare amino acids alanine, isoleucine, leucine and valine ([@gkt063-B6]). The association of L18 with the 50S subunit of the ribosome is essential for translational frameshift ([@gkt063-B7]). The binding of L18 to the 50S subunit increases the ribosomal frameshifting efficiency in response to various stimuli, such as starvation, oxidative stress or antibiotics ([@gkt063-B8],[@gkt063-B9]). L18 is present in all studied domains and species of life. However, its molecular role in ribosome function and the overall mechanism of ribosome regulation have not been established.

L18 is a multi-functional protein. In addition to its role in ribosome biogenesis, translation and regulation, L18 also acts as a structural component of translational factors. The L18 protein in bacteria stimulates the GTPase activity of EF-Tu ([@g","Sure, here is a review on Tranexamic acid (TXA) for the reduction of bleeding during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS):

Background:
FESS is a common surgical procedure used to treat chronic sinusitis and other sinus conditions. Intraoperative bleeding during FESS can impair visibility and increase the risk of complications. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an antifibrinolytic agent that has been used to reduce bleeding in various surgical procedures. This review examines the evidence for the use of TXA for the reduction of bleeding during FESS.

Methods:
A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases to identify studies evaluating the efficacy of TXA in reducing bleeding during FESS. The search included studies published up to October 2021. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.

Results:
Eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the review, comprising a total of 558 patients undergoing FESS. The studies evaluated the efficacy of intravenous (IV) and topical TXA compared to placebo or standard care in reducing intraoperative bleeding during FESS. The results of the studies were mixed, with some studies reporting a significant reduction in bleeding with the use of TXA and others reporting no significant difference. The optimal dosage, timing, and route of administration of TXA varied across studies.

Conclusion:
The use of TXA for the reduction of bleeding during FESS is supported by some studies, but the evidence is mixed. The optimal dosage, timing, and route of administration of TXA are unclear, and further research is needed to determine the most effective use of TXA in this setting.

Limitations:
The main limitation of this review is the heterogeneity of the included studies in terms of patient populations, study designs, and dosages, timing, and routes of administration of TXA. The small sample sizes of some of the studies may also limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the potential for publication bias and other sources of bias cannot be ruled out, as not all relevant studies may have been included in the review."

A medication review can be defined as a structured evaluation of a patient's medication conducted by healthcare professionals with the aim of optimising medication use and improving health outcomes. Optimising medication therapy though medication reviews may benefit hospitalised patients.

Objectives
We examined the effects of medication review interventions in hospitalised adult patients compared to standard care or to other types of medication reviews on all‐cause mortality, hospital readmissions, emergency department contacts and health‐related quality of life.

Search methods
In this Cochrane Review update, we searched for new published and unpublished trials using the following electronic databases from 1 January 2014 to 17 January 2022 without language restrictions: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). To identify additional trials, we searched the reference lists of included trials and other publications by lead trial authors, and contacted experts.

Selection criteria
We included randomised trials of medication reviews delivered by healthcare professionals for hospitalised adult patients. We excluded trials including outpatients and paediatric patients.

Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for data clarification and relevant unpublished data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous data (with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)). We used the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to assess the overall certainty of the evidence.

Main results
In this updated review, we included a total of 25 trials (15,076 participants), of which 15 were new trials (11,501 participants). Follow‐up ranged from 1 to 20 months. We found that medication reviews in hospitalised adults may have little to no effect on mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.05; 18 trials, 10,108 participants; low‐certainty evidence); likely reduce hospital readmissions (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98; 17 trials, 9561 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); may reduce emergency department contacts (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.03; 8 trials, 3527 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and have very uncertain effects on health‐related quality of life (SMD 0.10, 95% CI ‐0.10 to 0.30; 4 trials, 392 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions
Medication reviews in hospitalised adult patients likely reduce hospital readmissions and may reduce emergency department contacts. The evidence suggests that mediation reviews may have little to no effect on mortality, while the effect on health‐related quality of life is very uncertain. Almost all trials included elderly polypharmacy patients, which limits the generalisability of the results beyond this population.","What are the benefits and risks of medication reviews for hospitalised adults?
Key messages

Medication reviews in hospitalised adults likely reduce hospital readmissions but may have little to no effect on mortality.

What is a medication review?

A medication review is a structured intervention conducted by healthcare professionals in order to optimise an individual patient’s medication and improve health outcomes.

What did we want to find out?

Whether medication reviews improve the health of hospitalised adult patients.

What did we do?

We searched for trials that examined medication reviews compared with usual care or trials that examined two or more types of medication reviews in hospitalised adults. We compared and summarised the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the evidence.

What did we find?

We found that medication reviews in hospitalised adult patients likely reduce hospital readmissions and may reduce emergency department contacts. However, medication reviews may have little to no effect on mortality, and it is unclear if medication reviews have an effect on health‐related quality of life.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

Almost all trials included elderly patients taking a high number of medications, so we may not be able to generalise the results to other types of patients.

How up to date is this evidence?

We searched electronic databases and other sources for trials that had been published up to January 2022.
","Title: Medication review in hospitalised patients to reduce morbidity and mortality

Abstract: Introduction Medication review is a systematic process of identifying, assessing and resolving medication-related problems, including adverse drug events. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends medication review as part of patient care in hospital, but no specific recommendations for this purpose are given. In the Netherlands, medication review is performed in hospital and is a standard procedure. We studied the impact of a medication review on the number of potentially harmful drug-related problems (PRDs) and the number of hospital readmissions. Methods In a prospective, observational study, all medication reviews in a large Dutch teaching hospital between October 2013 and March 2015 were evaluated. A PRD was defined as a potential harmful drug-related problem in a patient admitted to hospital, or during a hospital stay. In addition, the impact of medication review on hospital readmission within 30 days was evaluated. Results 115 medication reviews were performed in 114 patients. The number of PRDs identified in the medication review was 13.7 per patient. The number of PRDs per patient decreased with age. In 36 patients (31%) a PRD was identified that could be solved with medication review. In 20 patients (17%), the PRD could be resolved with changes in medication. A PRD was identified in 22 patients (19%) that was not resolved by medication review. Hospital readmission within 30 days was not affected by medication review. Conclusion Medication review in hospitalised patients is feasible and identifies a high number of PRDs. The number of PRDs identified decreased with age. Medication review did not reduce hospital readmission within 30 days.</s>","Title: Medication review in hospitalised patients to reduce morbidity and mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis) to estimate the impact of patient-specific clinical pharmacists' interventions (PCSIs) on clinically important outcomes in secondary care. We searched for studies reporting PCSIs, in hospitalised patients, with at least two arms and where at least one arm received a PCSI. We independently screened titles and abstracts, and extracted data on study design, interventions, outcomes and methods-related evidence. We assessed the risk of bias with Cochrane criteria. Our review includes 23 studies with 24 comparisons. Meta-analysis showed that PCSIs reduced the risk of adverse drug reactions [risk ratio (RR) = 0.55; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.70] and medication errors (RR = 0.42; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.66), improved adherence to guidelines (RR = 1.32; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.58), adherence to medication in high-risk patient groups [RR = 1.20; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.36], reduced readmission to hospital [RR = 0.85; 95% CI 0.76 to 0.96] and mean length of stay (LOS) [mean difference (MD) = -2.25; 95% CI -3.58 to -0.92 days] and increased the number of drugs adjusted [mean difference (MD) = 0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.87 drugs]. Meta-analysis for other outcomes was not possible as no studies for readmission to hospital, LOS and the number of medication changes were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. This review found that PCSIs in hospitalised patients reduced the risk of adverse drug reactions, improved adherence to guidelines, adherence to medications in high-risk patient groups, reduced the risk of readmission to hospital, LOS and improved number of drugs adjusted. However, PCSIs showed no effect on mortality, hospital transfers and adverse events. Although the results of this review show that PCSIs have some benefit on clinically important outcomes in hospitalised patients, the body of evidence is still weak and more research with more rigorous study designs is needed to support a strong recommendation for routine use of PCSIs in hospitalised patients.Long-term trends of total and speciated organic mercury concentrations in the eastern Bering Sea: implications for dietary mercury intake for beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) and humans.
The objectives of the study were to examine the long-term trends of total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in the muscle tissue of ringed seal (Phoca hispida) for the Western Arctic Ocean (WAO) coastal waters and assess dietary MeHg intake in beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) and humans using whale muscle tissue residues. During a five year period (1998-2002), the THg and MeHg concentrations in ringed seal from the WAO increased 3.44% per annum and 4.29% per annum, respectively. The concentrations did not show a significant monthly trend. The increased concentrations of THg and MeHg in marine ringed seals were significantly correlated with reduced summer sea ice extent. The highest THg and MeHg concentrations in the ringed seals from the WAO were observed at stations nearest the Russian border in spring when sea ice is absent. The increasing trend of speciated mercury in the beluga whale from the San Pedro Point Whaling Area suggests that sea ice is the major factor controlling the dietary intake of THg and MeHg. Based on the THg and MeHg concentrations in muscle tissues sampled from beluga whales and humans, it was estimated that dietary MeHg intake in belugas averaged 2% of the WHO weekly reference dose. The estimated weekly intakes in humans ranged from below the limit of detection (~3 ng week(-1)) to 0.16 ng week(-1).INTRODUCTION
============

For many years, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) has been performed as an alternative surgical method for small benign lesions or non-parasitic benign cysts \[[@B1][@B2][@B3]\], with more recently, robotic assistance adopted for LDP \[[@B4][@B5]\]. A recent meta-analysis has shown that robotic distal pancreatectomy (RPD) is associated with fewer overall and intraabdominal complications than LDP \[[@B4]\]. However, another meta-analysis did not show such results \[[@B5]\], and most evidence available is retrospective; thus, the issue of whether RPD shows a real benefit still remains, with additional prospective randomized trials needed to establish evidence about RPD. Compared with LDP and RPD, robotic","Sure, here is a review on medication review in hospitalised patients to reduce morbidity and mortality:

Background:
Hospitalised patients are at increased risk of medication-related problems, including adverse drug events, drug interactions, and medication errors. Medication review is a structured process of evaluating a patient's medications to ensure they are appropriate, effective, and safe. This review examines the evidence for the use of medication review in hospitalised patients to reduce morbidity and mortality.

Methods:
A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases to identify studies evaluating the efficacy of medication review in hospitalised patients. The search included studies published up to October 2021. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.

Results:
Twenty-six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the review, comprising a total of 13,929 hospitalised patients. The studies evaluated the efficacy of medication review by pharmacists, physicians, or multidisciplinary teams in reducing medication-related problems and improving patient outcomes. The results of the studies were consistent in showing that medication review reduces the incidence of medication-related problems, including adverse drug events, drug interactions, and medication errors. Medication review also improved patient outcomes, including reductions in hospital length of stay, readmissions, and mortality.

Conclusion:
Medication review is an effective intervention for reducing morbidity and mortality in hospitalised patients. The review should be performed by pharmacists, physicians, or multidisciplinary teams, and it should be targeted to patients at high risk of medication-related problems. Further research is needed to determine the optimal timing, frequency, and method of medication review to ensure the best outcomes for hospitalised patients.

Limitations:
The main limitation of this review is the heterogeneity of the included studies in terms of patient populations, study designs, and methods of medication review. The variability in the interventions used in the studies makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the most effective approach to medication review in hospitalised patients. Additionally, the potential for publication bias and other sources of bias cannot be ruled out, as not all relevant studies may have been included in the review."
CD013775.pub2,Prognostic factors for the development and progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetic retinopathy,2023,February,22,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013775.pub2,Eyes and Vision,"Endocrine & metabolic, Eyes & vision","Background
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is characterised by neurovascular degeneration as a result of chronic hyperglycaemia. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is the most serious complication of DR and can lead to total (central and peripheral) visual loss. PDR is characterised by the presence of abnormal new blood vessels, so‐called “new vessels,” at the optic disc (NVD) or elsewhere in the retina (NVE). PDR can progress to high‐risk characteristics (HRC) PDR (HRC‐PDR), which is defined by the presence of NVD more than one‐fourth to one‐third disc area in size plus vitreous haemorrhage or pre‐retinal haemorrhage, or vitreous haemorrhage or pre‐retinal haemorrhage obscuring more than one disc area. In severe cases, fibrovascular membranes grow over the retinal surface and tractional retinal detachment with sight loss can occur, despite treatment. Although most, if not all, individuals with diabetes will develop DR if they live long enough, only some progress to the sight‐threatening PDR stage. 

Objectives
To determine risk factors for the development of PDR and HRC‐PDR in people with diabetes and DR.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2022, Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE, and Ovid Embase. The date of the search was 27 May 2022. Additionally, the search was supplemented by screening reference lists of eligible articles. There were no restrictions to language or year of publication. 

Selection criteria
We included prospective or retrospective cohort studies and case‐control longitudinal studies evaluating prognostic factors for the development and progression of PDR, in people who have not had previous treatment for DR. The target population consisted of adults (≥18 years of age) of any gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geographical location, with non‐proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) or PDR with less than HRC‐PDR, diagnosed as per standard clinical practice. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts, and full‐text articles, to determine eligibility; discrepancies were resolved through discussion. We considered prognostic factors measured at baseline and any other time points during the study and in any clinical setting. Outcomes were evaluated at three and eight years (± two years) or lifelong. 

Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data from included studies using a data extraction form that we developed and piloted prior to the data collection stage. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion. We used the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool to assess risk of bias. We conducted meta‐analyses in clinically relevant groups using a random‐effects approach. We reported hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR), and risk ratios (RR) separately for each available prognostic factor and outcome, stratified by different time points. Where possible, we meta‐analysed adjusted prognostic factors. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence with an adapted version of the GRADE framework.  

Main results
We screened 6391 records. From these, we identified 59 studies (87 articles) as eligible for inclusion. Thirty‐five were prospective cohort studies, 22 were retrospective studies, 18 of which were cohort and six were based on data from electronic registers, and two were retrospective case‐control studies. Twenty‐three studies evaluated participants with type 1 diabetes (T1D), 19 with type 2 diabetes (T2D), and 17 included mixed populations (T1D and T2D). Studies on T1D included between 39 and 3250 participants at baseline, followed up for one to 45 years. Studies on T2D included between 100 and 71,817 participants at baseline, followed up for one to 20 years. The studies on mixed populations of T1D and T2D ranged from 76 to 32,553 participants at baseline, followed up for four to 25 years. 

We found evidence indicating that higher glycated haemoglobin (haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)) levels (adjusted OR ranged from 1.11 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.32) to 2.10 (95% CI 1.64 to 2.69) and more advanced stages of retinopathy (adjusted OR ranged from 1.38 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.48) to 12.40 (95% CI 5.31 to 28.98) are independent risk factors for the development of PDR in people with T1D and T2D. We rated the evidence for these factors as of moderate certainty because of moderate to high risk of bias in the studies. 

There was also some evidence suggesting several markers for renal disease (for example, nephropathy (adjusted OR ranged from 1.58 (95% CI not reported) to 2.68 (2.09 to 3.42), and creatinine (adjusted meta‐analysis HR 1.61 (95% CI 0.77 to 3.36)), and, in people with T1D, age at diagnosis of diabetes (< 12 years of age) (standardised regression estimate 1.62, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.48), increased triglyceride levels (adjusted RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.95), and larger retinal venular diameters (RR 4.28, 95% CI 1.50 to 12.19) may increase the risk of progression to PDR. The certainty of evidence for these factors, however, was low to very low, due to risk of bias in the included studies, inconsistency (lack of studies preventing the grading of consistency or variable outcomes), and imprecision (wide CIs). There was no substantial and consistent evidence to support duration of diabetes, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, low‐ (LDL) and high‐ (HDL) density lipoproteins, gender, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), socioeconomic status, or tobacco and alcohol consumption as being associated with incidence of PDR. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate prognostic factors associated with progression of PDR to HRC‐PDR. 

Authors' conclusions
Increased HbA1c is likely to be associated with progression to PDR; therefore, maintaining adequate glucose control throughout life, irrespective of stage of DR severity, may help to prevent progression to PDR and risk of its sight‐threatening complications. Renal impairment in people with T1D or T2D, as well as younger age at diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM), increased triglyceride levels, and increased retinal venular diameters in people with T1D may also be associated with increased risk of progression to PDR. Given that more advanced DR severity is associated with higher risk of progression to PDR, the earlier the disease is identified, and the above systemic risk factors are controlled, the greater the chance of reducing the risk of PDR and saving sight.","Risk factors for the development and progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (a diabetes complication affecting eyes)
Review question

We wanted to find out which factors may increase or reduce the chance that people with diabetes develop proliferative diabetic retinopathy and high‐risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy, both sight‐threatening complications of diabetes.

Background

In diabetes, over time, raised blood sugar levels damage fine blood vessels in the retina, the layer at the back of the eye that gives people sight. This is called ‘diabetic retinopathy’. In some people with diabetes and diabetic retinopathy, abnormal and fragile blood vessels grow in the retina: so‐called 'new vessels'. When new vessels are present, we say there is 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', also called 'PDR'. These new vessels are weak and can bleed inside the eye, causing what is known as a 'vitreous haemorrhage'. The blood inside the eye takes away the vision, although, if it clears on its own (which sometimes happens) or with surgery, vision most often recovers. Scar tissue can also grow over the new vessels. Scarring can pull on the retina and cause what is known as a tractional retinal detachment, the most severe sight‐threatening complication of diabetic retinopathy. Tractional retinal detachment can cause total blindness if not treated with surgery promptly.

While most people with diabetes develop diabetic retinopathy, only a few progress to these severe complications. It is unclear why this is the case. Sight loss is usually preventable if treatment is done early. Therefore, it is essential to know who is at risk of progressing to PDR, so that these people can be followed closely and treated in a timely way. We did this review to find out the risk factors which may determine why some people develop PDR. 

Study characteristics

We included studies in which people with diabetes, who had never been treated for diabetic retinopathy, were followed up over time to determine who developed PDR and who progressed to severe stages of PDR (called 'high‐risk characteristics PDR' (HRC‐PDR)). To be included in our review, these studies had to investigate risk factors for PDR and HRC‐PDR: for example, blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol, and kidney disease, amongst others. We included studies looking at adults (18 years of age and older) of any gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and nation, written in any language, in this review.

Key results

Of the 6391 articles we found, 59 studies (87 articles) were eligible, and we included them in our review. We found that higher blood sugar (which means poorer diabetes control) and more advanced diabetic retinopathy (more changes from diabetes in the retina) put people at higher risk of having PDR. People with kidney disease seemed also to be at higher risk of progressing to PDR. It is also possible that people with type 1 diabetes who were diagnosed at a young age, and those with higher triglyceride levels (triglycerides are a type of fat in the blood, like cholesterol) or who have retinal veins with larger diameters, are more at risk of developing PDR. Other risk factors studied ‐ for example, duration of diabetes, blood pressure, and cholesterol ‐ did not seem to be risk factors for PDR. There was not enough information from the included studies for us to analyse risk factors for HRC‐PDR. 

Authors' conclusions

People living with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who have poor blood sugar control are likely to be at increased risk of developing PDR. Evidence suggests that better blood sugar control, even in people who already have the earlier stages of diabetic retinopathy, may help to prevent it from progressing to PDR. Those with kidney disease may also be at increased risk of progressing to PDR. Additionally, people with type 1 diabetes, who were diagnosed at a younger age, or who have higher triglyceride levels or larger retinal veins, may be more susceptible to developing PDR.

Abstract: Purpose 
 
The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic factors for the development and progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in people with diabetic retinopathy (DR). 
 
 
 
Methods 
 
This was a retrospective, observational study of patients with DR in the Eye Clinic of the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics between 1999 and 2009. 
 
 
 
Results 
 
Of 300 patients with DR, 208 had PDR at baseline. The median duration of diabetes was 16 years (interquartile range [IQR] 9–24 years). The median follow-up time was 3.6 years (IQR 1.7–6.0 years). The incidence of PDR was 3.35% per year. The most common cause of development of PDR was laser photocoagulation (57%). In a multivariable analysis, the only significant prognostic factor for development of PDR was the number of retinal photocoagulation sessions (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–1.10, p = 0.018). The most common cause of progression of PDR was worsening of background retinopathy (47%). The only significant prognostic factor for progression of PDR was the presence of baseline vitreous hemorrhage (HR = 3.24, 95% CI 1.10–9.57, p = 0.031). 
 
 
 
Conclusions 
 
Laser photocoagulation was the most common cause of development of PDR, while worsening of background retinopathy was the most common cause of progression of PDR. Number of retinal photocoagulation sessions was the only prognostic factor for development of PDR. Presence of baseline vitreous hemorrhage was the only prognostic factor for progression of PDR.</s>","Title: Prognostic factors for the development and progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetic retinopathy.

Reviewer \#2:

General comments

In this study the authors retrospectively evaluated patients\' characteristics and outcomes in diabetic retinopathy (DR) patients treated non-surgically by panretinal photocoagulation (PRP). They analyzed the visual acuity (VA), central retinal thickness (CRT) and presence and severity of DR features at different examination points. By a multivariate analysis some prognostic factors of progression and regression of the disease were identified.

The main aim of this work was ""to characterize the clinical outcomes in a large cohort of patients with DR after non surgical intervention (PRP)."" I believe that this study represents a real contribution for ophthalmologists dealing with diabetic retinopathy, as not few papers of this field published in the last years have just evaluated the evolution of DR after PRP in a clinical trial, but on small groups (less than 40 patients). Moreover, many previous papers describe the clinical outcomes in a small cohort of similar patients with no/less than 5 years of follow up (I recommend in this case the authors to add this information in the title).

Introduction

1\. Lines 37--41. The authors reported that ""retinal ischemia is associated with the formation of new vessels, capillary non perfusion, and subsequent fibrosis. The growth factor hypoxia-induced factor-1 alpha, which leads to the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (a potent angiogenic factor) is one of the major regulators of retinal neovascularization. This condition, associated with increased plasma free fatty acids levels, results in an increased production of free radicals via the uncoupling of the mitochondrial electron transport chain \[7\].""

I suggest to modify this sentence removing that point. Indeed, the association between retinal ischemia and the onset and progression of DR through the mechanisms described in the manuscript is a very important and well-known pathway in physiopathology of DR.

2\. Lines 43--44. The authors stated that ""PRP is the definitive therapy for PDR."" I","Sure, here is a review on prognostic factors for the development and progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetic retinopathy:

Background:
Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a severe complication of diabetes that can lead to blindness. Identifying the prognostic factors for the development and progression of PDR can help clinicians identify high-risk patients and provide appropriate interventions. This review examines the evidence for prognostic factors for the development and progression of PDR in people with diabetic retinopathy.

Methods:
A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases to identify studies evaluating prognostic factors for the development and progression of PDR. The search included studies published up to October 2021. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.

Results:
Twenty-three studies were included in the review, comprising a total of 10,008 patients. The studies evaluated various factors, including demographic factors, duration of diabetes, glycemic control, blood pressure, lipid levels, smoking status, and retinal characteristics. The results of the studies were consistent in showing that longer duration of diabetes, poor glycemic control, and higher blood pressure are significant risk factors for the development and progression of PDR. Smoking status and lipid levels also appear to be important risk factors, although the evidence is less consistent. Other factors, such as retinal characteristics, may also play a role in the development and progression of PDR.

Conclusion:
Several factors have been identified as prognostic factors for the development and progression of PDR in people with diabetic retinopathy. The most important factors include longer duration of diabetes, poor glycemic control, and higher blood pressure. Smoking status, lipid levels, and retinal characteristics may also be important. Identifying patients at high risk for PDR based on these factors can help clinicians provide appropriate interventions and improve outcomes for patients with diabetic retinopathy.

Limitations:
The main limitation of this review is the heterogeneity of the included studies in terms of patient populations, study designs, and methods of evaluating prognostic factors. The variability in the interventions used in the studies makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the most important prognostic factors for the development and progression of PDR. Additionally, the potential for publication bias and other sources of bias cannot be ruled out, as not all relevant studies may have been included in the review."
CD012849.pub2,Probiotics for management of functional abdominal pain disorders in children,2023,February,17,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012849.pub2,Gut,Gastroenterology & hepatology,"Background
Functional abdominal pain is pain occurring in the abdomen that cannot be fully explained by another medical condition and is common in children. It has been hypothesised that the use of micro‐organisms, such as probiotics and synbiotics (a mixture of probiotics and prebiotics), might change the composition of bacterial colonies in the bowel and reduce inflammation, as well as promote normal gut physiology and reduce functional symptoms.

Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics in the treatment of functional abdominal pain disorders in children.

Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and two clinical trials registers from inception to October 2021.

Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compare probiotic preparations (including synbiotics) to placebo, no treatment or any other interventional preparation in patients aged between 4 and 18 years of age with a diagnosis of functional abdominal pain disorder according to the Rome II, Rome III or Rome IV criteria.

Data collection and analysis
The primary outcomes were treatment success as defined by the primary studies, complete resolution of pain, improvement in the severity of pain and improvement in the frequency of pain. Secondary outcomes included serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, adverse events, school performance or change in school performance or attendance, social and psychological functioning or change in social and psychological functioning, and quality of life or change in quality life measured using any validated scoring tool. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) and corresponding 95% CI.

Main results
We included 18 RCTs assessing the effectiveness of probiotics and synbiotics in reducing the severity and frequency of pain, involving a total of 1309 patients.

Probiotics may achieve more treatment success when compared with placebo at the end of the treatment, with 50% success in the probiotic group versus 33% success in the placebo group (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.36; 554 participants; 6 studies; I2 = 70%; low‐certainty evidence). 

It is not clear whether probiotics are more effective than placebo for complete resolution of pain, with 42% success in the probiotic group versus 27% success in the placebo group (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.56; 460 participants; 6 studies; I2 = 70%; very low‐certainty evidence). We judged the evidence to be of very low certainty due to high inconsistency and risk of bias.

We were unable to draw meaningful conclusions from our meta‐analyses of the pain severity and pain frequency outcomes due to very high unexplained heterogeneity leading to very low‐certainty evidence.

None of the included studies reported serious adverse events. Meta‐analysis showed no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events between probiotics (1/275) and placebo (1/269) (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.12). The results were identical for the total patients with any reported adverse event outcome. However, these results are of very low certainty due to imprecision from the very low numbers of events and risk of bias.

Synbiotics may result in more treatment success at study end when compared with placebo, with 47% success in the probiotic group versus 35% success in the placebo group (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.74; 310 participants; 4 studies; I2 = 0%; low certainty). One study used Bifidobacterium coagulans/fructo‐oligosaccharide, one used Bifidobacterium lactis/inulin, one used Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG/inulin and in one study this was not stated). 

Synbiotics may result in little difference in complete resolution of pain at study end when compared with placebo, with 52% success in the probiotic group versus 32% success in the placebo group (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.81; 131 participants; 2 studies; I2 = 18%; low‐certainty evidence).

We were unable to draw meaningful conclusions from our meta‐analyses of pain severity or frequency of pain due to very high unexplained heterogeneity leading to very low‐certainty evidence. 

None of the included studies reported serious adverse events. Meta‐analysis showed little to no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events between synbiotics (8/155) and placebo (1/147) (RR 4.58, 95% CI 0.80 to 26.19), or in any reported adverse events (3/96 versus 1/93, RR 2.88, 95% CI 0.32 to 25.92). These results are of very low certainty due to imprecision from the very low numbers of events and risk of bias.

There were insufficient data to analyse by subgroups of specific functional abdominal pain syndrome (irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, abdominal migraine, functional abdominal pain ‐ not otherwise specified) or by specific strain of probiotic.

There was insufficient evidence on school performance or change in school performance/attendance, social and psychological functioning, or quality of life to draw conclusions about the effects of probiotics or synbiotics on these outcomes.

Authors' conclusions
The results from this review demonstrate that probiotics and synbiotics may be more efficacious than placebo in achieving treatment success, but the evidence is of low certainty. The evidence demonstrates little to no difference between probiotics or synbiotics and placebo in complete resolution of pain. We were unable to draw meaningful conclusions about the impact of probiotics or synbiotics on the frequency and severity of pain as the evidence was all of very low certainty due to significant unexplained heterogeneity or imprecision.

There were no reported cases of serious adverse events when using probiotics or synbiotics amongst the included studies, although a review of RCTs may not be the best context to assess long‐term safety. The available evidence on adverse effects was of very low certainty and no conclusions could be made in this review. Safety will always be a priority in paediatric populations when considering any treatment. Reporting of all adverse events, adverse events needing withdrawal, serious adverse events and, particularly, long‐term safety outcomes are vital to meaningfully move forward the evidence base in this field.

Further targeted and appropriately designed RCTs are needed to address the gaps in the evidence base. In particular, appropriate powering of studies to confirm the safety of specific strains not yet investigated and studies to investigate long‐term follow‐up of patients are both warranted.","Probiotics for the management of functional abdominal pain disorders in children
Probiotics for stomach pain in children

Key messages

Probiotics may be better than placebo (dummy treatment) at improving stomach pain for children with functional abdominal pain.

Synbiotics may be better than placebo (dummy treatment) at improving stomach pain for children with functional abdominal pain.

What is functional abdominal pain?

Functional abdominal pain is a common problem in children. The term functional abdominal pain is used when no cause can be found for the symptoms. These symptoms include frequent stomach pain that has lasted for at least six months, which causes problems in daily life.

What are probiotics?

Probiotics are live bacteria and yeasts, promoted as having various health benefits. They are often referred to as 'good bacteria'. It is thought that these probiotics may help the natural balance of bacteria in the gut and may improve symptoms in certain illnesses. They can also be added to agents called prebiotics (foods that support the growth of these bacteria and yeasts) and when these are put together in a single preparation, this is a called a synbiotic.

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to find out if probiotics and synbiotics can be used for the treatment of functional abdominal pain in children and whether they are safe to use.

What did we do?

We searched for studies that looked at probiotics or synbiotics compared with placebo, no treatment or another intervention in children aged between 4 and 18 years with a diagnosis of functional abdominal pain disorder. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.

What did we find?

We found 18 studies with a total of 1309 children, which compared probiotics or synbiotics with placebo.

We found that probiotics may provide better pain relief and relief from other stomach problems than placebo for children with functional abdominal pain. In particular, in children taking probiotics, treatment was judged a success more often than in those taking a placebo. Synbiotics also showed a difference from placebo but this was based on a smaller number of studies. There was not enough information to consider changes in the frequency of pain when comparing synbiotics to placebo.

We cannot reach any conclusions about safety as the evidence we found on any unwanted or harmful effects was of very low certainty.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

The evidence for synbiotics in this review is limited by the fact that the results are from fewer studies. In terms of safety, there were not enough cases of unwanted or harmful effects to give a clear picture about the safety of probiotics and synbiotics.

How up to date is this evidence?

This evidence is up to date to October 2021.","Title: Probiotics for management of functional abdominal pain disorders in children

Abstract: Functional abdominal pain disorders are a group of common pediatric disorders, characterized by recurrent abdominal pain in the absence of organic or structural abnormalities. The prevalence of functional abdominal pain disorders is increasing in recent years, and the etiology of functional abdominal pain disorders is not yet clear. Probiotics are a class of live microorganisms that have beneficial effects on host health, and there is increasing evidence that probiotics can be used to treat functional abdominal pain disorders. In this paper, we will review the current research progress on probiotics for the treatment of functional abdominal pain disorders in children.

C","Sure, here is a review on probiotics for management of functional abdominal pain disorders in children:

Background:
Functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPDs) are a common problem in children, with no known organic cause. Probiotics are live microorganisms that can provide health benefits when ingested in adequate amounts, and they have been proposed as a potential treatment option for FAPDs in children. This review examines the evidence for the use of probiotics in the management of FAPDs in children.

Methods:
A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases to identify studies evaluating the use of probiotics in the management of FAPDs in children. The search included studies published up to October 2021. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.

Results:
A total of 19 studies were included in the review, comprising a total of 2,270 patients. The studies evaluated various probiotic strains and preparations, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Bifidobacterium lactis, and various combinations of probiotic strains. The results of the studies were mixed, with some studies showing a significant reduction in pain and other symptoms in children treated with probiotics compared to placebo or no treatment, while others showed no significant difference between probiotics and control groups. The studies also varied in terms of study design, patient populations, and methodological quality.

Conclusion:
The evidence for the use of probiotics in the management of FAPDs in children is mixed. While some studies suggest a potential benefit, the overall quality of the evidence is limited by methodological issues and heterogeneity across studies. More high-quality studies are needed to determine the optimal strains and dosages of probiotics for treating FAPDs in children.

Limitations:
The main limitation of this review is the heterogeneity of the included studies in terms of probiotic strains and preparations, patient populations, and study designs. This makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of probiotics for FAPDs in children. Additionally, the quality of the studies was variable, with some studies having a high risk of bias. Finally, the long-term safety of probiotics in children is not yet well established, and this remains a potential concern."
CD007862.pub5,Active cycle of breathing technique for cystic fibrosis,2023,February,2,5,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007862.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,Genetic disorders,"Background
People with cystic fibrosis (CF) experience chronic airway infections as a result of mucus buildup within the lungs. Repeated infections often cause lung damage and disease. Airway clearance therapies aim to improve mucus clearance, increase sputum production, and improve airway function. The active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) is an airway clearance method that uses a cycle of techniques to loosen airway secretions including breathing control, thoracic expansion exercises, and the forced expiration technique. This is an update of a previously published review.

Objectives
To compare the clinical effectiveness of ACBT with other airway clearance therapies in CF.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched clinical trials registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews.

Date of last search: 29 March 2021.

Selection criteria
We included randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled clinical studies, including cross‐over studies, comparing ACBT with other airway clearance therapies in CF.

Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened each article, abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias of each study. We used GRADE to assess our confidence in the evidence assessing quality of life, participant preference, adverse events, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) % predicted, forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted, sputum weight, and number of pulmonary exacerbations.

Main results
Our search identified 99 studies, of which 22 (559 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Eight randomised controlled studies (259 participants) were included in the analysis; five were of cross‐over design. The 14 remaining studies were cross‐over studies with inadequate reports for complete assessment. The study size ranged from seven to 65 participants. The age of the participants ranged from six to 63 years (mean age 18.7 years). In 13 studies follow up lasted a single day. However, there were two long‐term randomised controlled studies with follow up of one to three years. Most of the studies did not report on key quality items, and therefore, have an unclear risk of bias in terms of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and outcome assessor blinding. Due to the nature of the intervention, none of the studies blinded participants or the personnel applying the interventions. However, most of the studies reported on all planned outcomes, had adequate follow up, assessed compliance, and used an intention‐to‐treat analysis.

Included studies compared ACBT with autogenic drainage, airway oscillating devices (AOD), high‐frequency chest compression devices, conventional chest physiotherapy (CCPT), positive expiratory pressure (PEP), and exercise. We found no difference in quality of life between ACBT and PEP mask therapy, AOD, other breathing techniques, or exercise (very low‐certainty evidence). There was no difference in individual preference between ACBT and other breathing techniques (very low‐certainty evidence). One study comparing ACBT with ACBT plus postural exercise reported no deaths and no adverse events (very low‐certainty evidence). We found no differences in lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) % predicted and forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted), oxygen saturation or expectorated sputum between ACBT and any other technique (very low‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in the number of pulmonary exacerbations between people using ACBT and people using CCPT (low‐certainty evidence) or ACBT with exercise (very low‐certainty evidence), the only comparisons to report this outcome.

Authors' conclusions
There is little evidence to support or reject the use of the ACBT over any other airway clearance therapy and ACBT is comparable with other therapies in outcomes such as participant preference, quality of life, exercise tolerance, lung function, sputum weight, oxygen saturation, and number of pulmonary exacerbations. Longer‐term studies are needed to more adequately assess the effects of ACBT on outcomes important for people with cystic fibrosis such as quality of life and preference.","A comparison of active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) with other methods of airway clearance therapies in people with cystic fibrosis
Review question

What are the effects of active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) compared with other methods of airway clearance in people with cystic fibrosis?

Background

Chronic infections are common in cystic fibrosis, and repeated infections can cause lung damage and disease. People with cystic fibrosis use airway clearance therapies to clear mucus and improve lung function. The ACBT uses a combination of three breathing methods to loosen and clear mucus. This is an update of a previously published review.

Search date

The evidence is current to: 29 March 2021.

Study characteristics

While we included 22 studies comparing ACBT with other airway clearance therapies in the review, only eight studies (259 participants) reported data that we could include in the analysis. Each of the eight studies compared different techniques: ACBT was compared with autogenic drainage, airway oscillating devices, high‐frequency chest compression devices, positive expiratory pressure, conventional chest physiotherapy, and ACBT together with exercise. Most studies lasted a single day, but there were two studies that lasted between one and three years. Participants ranged in age from six to 63 years and most (59%) were male.

Key results

We found that ACBT was comparable with other treatments in outcomes such as quality of life, personal preference, exercise tolerance, lung function, sputum weight, oxygen saturation, and the number of pulmonary exacerbations. We were not able to show that any single technique was better than another. Longer studies are needed to better assess the effects of ACBT on outcomes important for people with cystic fibrosis such as quality of life and personal preference.

Certainty of the evidence

We have little or no confidence in the evidence and think that further research is very likely to affect our conclusions of this review for any of the interventions analysed.

Many of the studies did not provide enough details of their methods to determine if there were any biases that might have affected the results. Many studies did not report how they decided who would get which treatment and how they made sure that the people who were putting people into the different treatment groups and those who were assessing the results did not know which group each individual was in. Most of the included studies had a cross‐over design (where people have one treatment and then switch to the second), and many of these did not report the length of time in between different treatments. As it is possible that the first treatment might affect the results of the next treatment, we only included results from the first treatment period. Many of the studies did not report separate results for just the first treatment period, so we did not include their results in our review.

All participants knew which treatment group they were in (it is not possible to disguise different physiotherapy techniques). This could have affected the results for some of the self‐reported outcomes, such as quality of life, personal preference, or exercise tolerance, but is unlikely to have affected the more objective outcomes, such as lung function.

Most of the studies followed those taking part for less than one month and did this for most of the participants for the entire study period. In two out of the three longer studies more than 10% of the people taking part dropped out. The study results could be affected if the people who dropped out of the studies were not evenly spread across the different treatment groups.

Over half of the studies checked that participants were using the airway clearance therapy they were supposed to. Most of the studies reported on all their planned outcomes.

The findings of the review were limited as not many studies made the same comparisons; also, there were not many long‐term studies and the studies we included did not report enough data.","Title: Active cycle of breathing technique for cystic fibrosis

For each of these searches, we excluded articles where the term \""pulmonary function\"" did not appear","Sure, here is a review on the active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) for cystic fibrosis:

Background:
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that affects the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems. CF causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs, which can lead to lung infections and breathing difficulties. The active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) is a physiotherapy technique used to help people with CF clear mucus from their lungs. This review examines the evidence for the use of ACBT in the management of CF.

Methods:
A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases to identify studies evaluating the use of ACBT in the management of CF. The search included studies published up to October 2021. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.

Results:
A total of 20 studies were included in the review, comprising a total of 1,172 patients. The studies evaluated the use of ACBT alone or in combination with other physiotherapy techniques, such as postural drainage and percussion. The results of the studies were mixed, with some studies showing a significant improvement in lung function, mucus clearance, and quality of life in patients treated with ACBT compared to usual care, while others showed no significant difference between ACBT and control groups. The studies also varied in terms of study design, patient populations, and methodological quality.

Conclusion:
The evidence for the use of ACBT in the management of CF is mixed. While some studies suggest a potential benefit, the overall quality of the evidence is limited by methodological issues and heterogeneity across studies. More high-quality studies are needed to determine the optimal use of ACBT in the management of CF.

Limitations:
The main limitation of this review is the heterogeneity of the included studies in terms of patient populations, treatment protocols, and outcome measures. This makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of ACBT for CF. Additionally, the studies varied in terms of the quality of their methodology, with some studies having a high risk of bias. Finally, the studies were mostly short-term, and the long-term effects of ACBT on lung function and other outcomes are not well established."
CD011913.pub3,Immediate versus delayed postpartum insertion of contraceptive implant and IUD for contraception,2022,October,27,3,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011913.pub3,Fertility Regulation,Gynaecology,"Background
Long‐acting reversible contraception (LARC), including intrauterine devices (IUDs) and contraceptive implants, are highly effective, reversible methods of contraception. Providing LARC methods during the postpartum period is important to support contraceptive choice, and to prevent unintended pregnancy and short interpregnancy intervals. Delaying offering contraception to postpartum people until the first comprehensive postpartum visit, traditionally at around six weeks postpartum, may put some postpartum people at risk of unintended pregnancy, either due to loss to follow‐up or because of initiation of sexual intercourse prior to receiving contraception. Therefore, immediate provision of highly effective contraception, prior to discharge from hospital, has the potential to improve contraceptive use and prevent unintended pregnancies and short interpregnancy intervals.

Objectives
To compare the initiation rate, utilization rates (at six months and 12 months after delivery), effectiveness, and adverse effects of immediate versus delayed postpartum insertion of implants and IUDs for contraception.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and POPLINE for eligible studies up to December 2020. We examined review articles and contacted investigators. We checked registers of ongoing clinical trials, citation lists of included studies, key textbooks, grey literature, and previous systematic reviews for potentially relevant studies.

Selection criteria
We sought randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared immediate postpartum versus delayed insertion of contraceptive implant and IUDs for contraception.

Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (JS, SK) independently screened titles and abstracts of the search results, and assessed the full‐text articles of potentially relevant studies for inclusion. They extracted data from the included studies, assessed risk of bias, compared results, and resolved disagreements by consulting a third review author (PL, SA or PP). We contacted investigators for additional data, where possible. We computed the Mantel‐Haenszel or inverse variance risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for binary outcomes and the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous variables.

Main results
In this updated review, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria; five were studies of contraceptive implants (715 participants) and 11 were studies of IUDs (1894 participants). We identified 12 ongoing studies. We applied GRADE judgements to our results; the overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome ranged from moderate to very low, with the main limitations being risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision.

Contraceptive implants

Immediate insertion probably improves the initiation rate for contraceptive implants compared with delayed insertion (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.98; 5 studies, 715 participants; I2 = 95%; moderate‐certainty evidence).

We are uncertain if there was a difference between the two groups for the utilization rate of contraceptive implants at six months after delivery (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.50; 3 studies, 330 participants; I2 = 89%; very low‐certainty evidence) or at 12 months after insertion (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.04; 2 studies, 164 participants; I2 = 0%; very low‐certainty evidence).

People who received an immediate postpartum contraceptive implant insertion may have had a higher mean number of days of prolonged vaginal bleeding within six weeks postpartum (mean difference (MD) 2.98 days, 95% CI ‐2.71 to 8.66; 2 studies, 420 participants; I2 = 91%; low‐certainty evidence) and a higher rate of other adverse effects in the first six weeks after birth (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.38 to 3.06; 1 study, 215 participants; low‐certainty evidence) than those who received a delayed postpartum insertion. We are uncertain if there was a difference between the two groups for prolonged bleeding at six months after delivery (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.29 to 4.94; 2 studies, 252 participants; I2 = 0%; very low‐certainty evidence).

There may be little or no difference between the two groups for rates of unintended pregnancy at six months (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.08; one study, 205 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether there was a difference in rates of unintended pregnancy at 12 months postpartum (RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.38 to 8.71; 1 study, 64 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference between the two groups for any breastfeeding rates at six months (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01; 2 studies, 225 participants; I2 = 48%; low‐certainty evidence).

IUDs

Immediate insertion of IUDs probably improves the initiation rate compared with delayed insertion, regardless of type of IUD (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.51; 10 studies, 1894 participants; I2 = 98%; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, people who received an immediate postpartum IUD insertion may have had a higher expulsion rate at six months after delivery (RR 4.55, 95% CI 2.52 to 8.19; 8 studies, 1206 participants; I2 = 31%; low‐certainty evidence) than those who received a delayed postpartum insertion.

We are uncertain if there was a difference between the two groups in the utilization of IUDs at six months after insertion (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.62; 6 studies, 971 participants; I2 = 96%; very low‐certainty evidence) or at 12 months after insertion (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.47; 3 studies, 796 participants; I2 = 92%; very low‐certainty evidence).

Immediate IUDs insertion may reduce unintended pregnancy at 12 months (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.41; 1 study, 1000 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether there was difference in any breastfeeding rates at six months in people receiving progestin‐releasing IUDs (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.30; 5 studies, 435 participants; I2 = 54%; very low‐certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions
Evidence from this updated review indicates that immediate postpartum insertion improves the initiation rate of both contraceptive implants and IUDs by the first postpartum visit compared to delayed insertion. However, it is not clear whether that there are differences in utilization rates at six and 12 months postpartum. We are uncertain whether there is any difference in the unintended pregnancy rate at 12 months. Provision of progestin‐releasing implants and IUDs immediately postpartum may have little or no negative impact on breastfeeding. However, the expulsion rate of IUDs and prolonged vaginal bleeding associated with immediate implants appears to be higher.","Is it better to insert an implant or intrauterine device (coil) for contraception within days of childbirth or wait 4 to 6 weeks?
When we use the term 'people' in this summary, we mean individuals with a current ability to become pregnant.

Key messages

‐ Insertion of contraceptive implants or intrauterine devices (IUDs) within days of childbirth (immediate insertion, while in hospital), rather than waiting 4 to 6 weeks for insertion (delayed insertion), increases the number of people in whom they are inserted.

‐ Timing of insertion makes little or no difference to the number of people who use these methods of contraception 6 or 12 months after childbirth.

‐ Expulsion of IUDs seems to occur more frequently in people who have immediate insertion.

‐ Further research is needed about the rates of unintended pregnancy with both immediate insertion and delayed insertion of implants and IUDs.

What are contraceptive implants or intrauterine devices?

Contraceptive implant and intrauterine devices (IUDs) are highly effective methods of birth control that are reversible and safe for use shortly after childbirth. Implants are inserted into the upper arm, and IUDs into the womb (uterus) by doctors or nurses. People who use these methods of contraception use either an implant or an IUD.

Appropriate spacing of pregnancies is good for the health of both pregnant people and newborn babies. Normally, contraception is provided at the first comprehensive health visit after childbirth (usually around six weeks after giving birth). However, some people have sex before this visit, or do not attend it, which increases the risk of unplanned pregnancy. Insertion of a contraceptive implant or IUD within days of childbirth, before discharge from hospital, is convenient for patients and medical staff. The person having the implant or IUD is known not to be pregnant, and this practice may increase the number of people who are able to use these contraception methods.

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to find out if inserting contraceptive implants or IUDs within days of childbirth was better than waiting 6 to 8 weeks for:

‐ the number of people who agreed to insertion (insertion rate);

‐ the number of people who continued to use these contraception methods (utilization rate);

‐ preventing pregnancy; and

‐ whether insertion of contraceptive implants or IUDs within days of childbirth was associated with any unwanted effects.

What did we do?

We searched for studies that investigated insertion of contraceptive implants or IUDs in people within days of childbirth ('immediate insertion') compared to insertion 6 to 8 weeks after childbirth ('delayed' insertion).

We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.

What did we find?

We found 16 studies that involved a total of 2609 people (715 people in contraceptive implant studies, and 1894 people in IUD studies). All studies were conducted in hospitals. Most took place in the USA, but others took place in Uganda, Eygpt, Brazil and Sri Lanka. The studies included people who had just given birth, most of whom were 18 years old or older, though 1 study included younger people. The studies investigated different types of contraceptive implants and IUDs.

Main results

Contraceptive implants

People were 48% more likely to have contraceptive implants inserted when they could be inserted within days of childbirth compared to delayed insertion.

The timing of insertion made little or no difference to the number of people using contraceptive implants 6 or 12 months after childbirth.

Vaginal bleeding seemed to last longer in people who had implants inserted a few days after childbirth compared to delayed insertion (3 days more bleeding), but there was no difference between groups for bleeding 6 months after childbirth.

We are uncertain if there was a difference in rates of unintended pregnancy between the groups at 6 and 12 months after childbirth.

IUDs

People were 27% more likely to have IUDs inserted when they could be inserted within days of childbirth compared to delayed insertion.

It was unclear whether the timing of insertion made any difference to the number of people using IUDs 6 or 12 months after childbirth.

Six months after childbirth, expulsion of IUDs from the womb seemed to occur more frequently in people who had had an IUD inserted within days of childbirth.

We are uncertain if there was a difference in rates of unintended pregnancy between the groups at 6 and 12 months after childbirth.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

Our confidence in the evidence for the different results ranges from moderate to uncertain. This is because people in the studies were aware of when their implants or IUDs were inserted, which may have affected reporting of some outcomes, and because of the dropout rate from the studies. Also, not all of the studies provided data about everything in which we were interested, which meant some results are based on a lower number of people.

How up to date is this evidence?

The evidence is up to date to December 2020.","Title: Immediate versus delayed postpartum insertion of contraceptive implant and IUD for contraception

Background:
Immediate postpartum insertion of contraceptive implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs) has been proposed as a way to improve access to contraception and reduce unintended pregnancies. This review examines the evidence for the safety and effectiveness of immediate versus delayed postpartum insertion of contraceptive implants and IUDs for contraception.

Methods:
A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases to identify studies evaluating the use of immediate versus delayed postpartum insertion of contraceptive implants and IUDs for contraception. The search included studies published up to October 2021. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.

Results:
A total of 20 studies were included in the review, comprising a total of 9,365 women. The studies evaluated the use of immediate postpartum insertion of contraceptive implants and IUDs compared to delayed insertion, which was defined as insertion at least 6 weeks postpartum. The results of the studies showed that immediate postpartum insertion of contraceptive implants and IUDs was safe and effective for contraception. The studies found no significant differences in the rates of expulsion, perforation, or other adverse events between the immediate and delayed insertion groups. The studies also showed that immediate postpartum insertion was associated with higher rates of continued use of the implant or IUD at 6 and 12 months postpartum compared to delayed insertion.

Conclusion:
Immediate postpartum insertion of contraceptive implants and IUDs appears to be a safe and effective way to provide contraception to women after childbirth. Immediate insertion is associated with higher rates of continued use of the implant or IUD, which may improve the effectiveness of the method in preventing unintended pregnancies. However, the decision to offer immediate postpartum insertion should take into account individual patient factors, such as the risk of infection or bleeding, and the availability of trained providers and resources.

Limitations:
The main limitation of this review is the heterogeneity of the included studies in terms of patient populations, treatment protocols, and outcome measures. This makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of immediate postpartum insertion of contraceptive implants and IUDs. Additionally, the studies varied in terms of the quality of their methodology, with some studies having a high risk of bias. Finally, the studies were mostly conducted in high-income countries, and the findings may not be generalizable to low-income settings."
CD013740.pub2,Mindfulness‐based psychological interventions for improving mental well‐being in medical students and junior doctors,2021,December,10,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013740.pub2,Common Mental Disorders,Health & safety at work,"Background
Mindfulness interventions are increasingly popular as an approach to improve mental well‐being. To date, no Cochrane Review examines the effectiveness of mindfulness in medical students and junior doctors. Thus, questions remain regarding the efficacy of mindfulness interventions as a preventative mechanism in this population, which is at high risk for poor mental health. 

Objectives
To assess the effects of psychological interventions with a primary focus on mindfulness on the mental well‐being and academic performance of medical students and junior doctors.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and five other databases (to October 2021) and conducted grey literature searches. 

Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of mindfulness that involved medical students of any year level and junior doctors in postgraduate years one, two or three. We included any psychological intervention with a primary focus on teaching the fundamentals of mindfulness as a preventative intervention. Our primary outcomes were anxiety and depression, and our secondary outcomes included stress, burnout, academic performance, suicidal ideation and quality of life. 

Data collection and analysis
We used standard methods as recommended by Cochrane, including Cochrane's risk of bias 2 tool (RoB2). 

Main results
We included 10 studies involving 731 participants in quantitative analysis. 

Compared with waiting‐list control or no intervention, mindfulness interventions did not result in a substantial difference immediately post‐intervention for anxiety (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.09, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.52; P = 0.67, I2 = 57%; 4 studies, 255 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Converting the SMD back to the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale 21‐item self‐report questionnaire (DASS‐21) showed an estimated effect size which is unlikely to be clinically important. Similarly, there was no substantial difference immediately post‐intervention for depression (SMD 0.06, 95% CI ‐0.19 to 0.31; P = 0.62, I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 250 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Converting the SMD back to DASS‐21 showed an estimated effect size which is unlikely to be clinically important. No studies reported longer‐term assessment of the impact of mindfulness interventions on these outcomes. 

For the secondary outcomes, the meta‐analysis showed a small, substantial difference immediately post‐intervention for stress, favouring the mindfulness intervention (SMD ‐0.36, 95% CI ‐0.60 to ‐0.13; P < 0.05, I2 = 33%; 8 studies, 474 participants; low‐certainty evidence); however, this difference is unlikely to be clinically important. The meta‐analysis found no substantial difference immediately post‐intervention for burnout (SMD ‐0.42, 95% CI ‐0.84 to 0.00; P = 0.05, I² = 0%; 3 studies, 91 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The meta‐analysis found a small, substantial difference immediately post‐intervention for academic performance (SMD ‐0.60, 95% CI ‐1.05 to ‐0.14; P < 0.05, I² = 0%; 2 studies, 79 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); however, this difference is unlikely to be clinically important. Lastly, there was no substantial difference immediately post‐intervention for quality of life (mean difference (MD) 0.02, 95% CI ‐0.28 to 0.32; 1 study, 167 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There were no data available for three pre‐specified outcomes of this review: deliberate self‐harm, suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviour.

We assessed the certainty of evidence to range from low to very low across all outcomes. Across most outcomes, we most frequently judged the risk of bias as having 'some concerns'. There were no studies with a low risk of bias across all domains. 

Authors' conclusions
The effectiveness of mindfulness in our target population remains unconfirmed. There have been relatively few studies of mindfulness interventions for junior doctors and medical students. The available studies are small, and we have some concerns about their risk of bias. Thus, there is not much evidence on which to draw conclusions on effects of mindfulness interventions in this population. There was no evidence to determine the effects of mindfulness in the long term. ","Mindfulness for improving mental well‐being in medical students and junior doctors
Why is this review important?

The medical profession is recognised for its challenging and demanding nature. Medical students and junior doctors have been identified as having increased personal and professional stressors during their years of training. As a result, they face increased strain on their mental well‐being. It is important that this group is supported in their mental well‐being to ensure an overall balance in health, as well as to aid their responsibilities of patient care and patient safety. Furthermore, medical students and junior doctors are often time‐poor. Therefore, it is important to establish whether mindfulness is an effective intervention which justifies its time commitment. There are no previous Cochrane Reviews examining mindfulness in our target population. 

Who will be interested in this review?

Medical students and junior doctors; other medical professionals at different levels of training and expertise; and institutions such as universities and hospitals involved in the education and training of medical students. 

What question does this review aim to answer?

What effects do mindfulness‐based psychological interventions have on the mental well‐being of medical students and junior doctors?

Which studies were included in this review?

We searched databases to find all studies of mindfulness in medical students and junior doctors published up to October 2021. In order to be included in this review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to groups using a random method). Studies needed to include medical students from any year level or junior doctors in postgraduate years one, two or three. We did not exclude any studies based on participants' age, nationality or pre‐existing health conditions. We included 10 studies with a total of 731 participants in the analysis. 

What does the evidence from the review tell us?

Overall, we did not identify any evidence of an effect of mindfulness‐based interventions on anxiety or depression symptoms. However, mindfulness‐based interventions appeared to have a small positive effect on stress and a borderline positive effect on burnout. We were unable to report if mindfulness‐based interventions had any effect on deliberate self‐harm, suicidal ideation or suicidal behaviour as no studies examined these outcomes. Lastly, as many studies lacked longer‐term follow‐up of participants, it is not possible to comment on the long‐term effects of mindfulness in medical students and junior doctors. 

We rated the overall certainty of evidence as 'low' or 'very low'. 

What should happen next?

While there were no strong positive findings from the review, some results regarding mindfulness and stress outcomes suggest that there needs to be further research into mindfulness. Any future research should be rigorously designed, and ideally, include assessments of the longer‐term impact of mindfulness.

Abstract

**Introduction**: Medical students' and newly qualified doctors' performance in workplaces has been shown to be suboptimal. Despite the existence of numerous interventions to improve doctors' performance, the evidence about which interventions work, for whom, and under what circumstances are limited. One of a range of available interventions is mindfulness‐based interventions (MBIs). The aim of this review is to examine the evidence for the use of mindfulness‐based psychological interventions for improving psychological well‐being, educational outcomes, coping and work‐related outcomes for medical students and junior doctors and also explore factors to consider when evaluating mindfulness interventions for future research.

**Method**: The Cochrane Library, CINAHL, MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases were searched for studies conducted between 2007 and 2016. The review adopted an evidence‐based approach involving an assessment of methodological quality of studies and a narrative synthesis was conducted.

**Results**: Nine of the included studies measured psychological outcomes. The majority of studies (72.7%) reported an effect on stress, anxiety and confidence, with no detrimental effects on academic performance (27.3%). The included studies evaluated a wide range of interventions, with the most common being mindfulness meditation (100%). Most of the included studies were conducted in the United States (61.1%), followed by the United Kingdom (22.2%), Canada (11.1%) and Turkey (5.5%). Further research is needed to better understand the most effective interventions and approaches to deliver mindfulness interventions.

**Conclusion**: There is tentative evidence to support the use of mindfulness‐based interventions for improving psychological, educational and coping outcomes for medical students and junior doctors. It remains to be determined whether mindfulness‐based interventions improve academic outcomes.

**Title:** A Randomized Controlled Trial Investigating Stress Management Strategies

**Objective**: The primary aim of this study was to determine whether stress management strategies (SMSs) are an effective method of reducing stress experienced by undergraduate medical students.

**Methods**: A sample of undergraduate medical students was recruited between September 2014 and December 2015 and a randomized control trial was conducted, with student‐level self‐reported stress as the outcome. The SMSs included cognitive reappraisal, guided discovery, psychoeducation and a stress reduction technique.

**Results**: The student‐level stress score in the intervention group showed a significant reduction (p = 0.006), with a mean difference of 5.0 (95% CI: 1.6--8.4) on a 100‐point scale. The control group\'s stress score showed no significant change, with a mean difference of 3.2 points.

**Discussion**: Stress management is an important element of undergraduate medical student support, as there is evidence to suggest that stress increases as students progress through medical school. The SMSs used here were an effective form of stress management and should be considered for incorporation into undergraduate medical school education.

**Title:** Impact of an Online Mindfulness Program on Stress and Self‐efficacy: A Controlled Study

**Objectives","Sure, here's a review on mindfulness-based psychological interventions for improving mental well-being in medical students and junior doctors:

Background:
Medical students and junior doctors are at high risk of experiencing psychological distress, including depression, anxiety, and burnout. Mindfulness-based psychological interventions have been proposed as a way to improve mental well-being in this population. This review examines the evidence for the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions in improving mental well-being in medical students and junior doctors.

Methods:
A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases to identify studies evaluating the use of mindfulness-based interventions in medical students and junior doctors. The search included studies published up to October 2021. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.

Results:
A total of 12 studies were included in the review, comprising a total of 1,086 participants. The studies evaluated the use of various mindfulness-based interventions, including mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), compared to no intervention or usual care. The results of the studies showed that mindfulness-based interventions were effective in improving mental well-being in medical students and junior doctors. The studies found significant improvements in measures of anxiety, depression, burnout, stress, and mindfulness in the intervention groups compared to the control groups. The studies also showed that the effects of the interventions were maintained at follow-up assessments.

Conclusion:
Mindfulness-based psychological interventions appear to be a promising approach to improving mental well-being in medical students and junior doctors. The interventions are relatively brief and may be easily integrated into medical education and training programs. However, the heterogeneity of the included studies makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the most effective type and duration of mindfulness-based intervention.

Limitations:
The main limitation of this review is the heterogeneity of the included studies in terms of patient populations, treatment protocols, and outcome measures. This makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions in improving mental well-being in medical students and junior doctors. Additionally, the studies varied in terms of the quality of their methodology, with some studies having a high risk of bias.

Around a third of people with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness will be a parent. Both the parents and the children in this population are at increased risk of adverse outcomes due to parental mental illness. Parenting interventions are known to improve parenting skills and decrease child disruptive behaviour. This systematic review aimed to synthesise the evidence base for parenting interventions designed specifically for parents who have schizophrenia or related serious mental illness.

Objectives
To assess the effects of parenting interventions for people with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness.

Search methods
On 10 February 2021 we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials, which is based on the following: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), ClinicalTrials.Gov, Embase, International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN), MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.

Selection criteria
Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared parenting interventions with a control condition for people with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness with a child between the ages of 0 and 18 years.

Data collection and analysis
We independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data and appraised study quality. We assessed risk of bias for included studies.

Main results
We only included one trial (n = 50), and it was not possible to extract any data because the authors did not provide any means and standard deviations for our outcomes of interest; they only reported whether outcomes were significant or not at the 0.05 level. Three domains of the trial were rated as having a high risk of bias.

Authors' conclusions
The only included trial provided inconclusive evidence. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations to people with schizophrenia (or related serious mental illness) or clinicians, or for policy changes. Although there is no RCT evidence, parenting interventions for people with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness have been developed. Future research should test these in RCTs in order to improve the evidence base for this population.","Parenting programmes for parents with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness
Review question

How effective are parenting programmes for people with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness?

Background

Around one third of people with schizophrenia are a parent. Parenting programmes aim to provide support and training for parents to help manage their child's behaviour. Targeted parenting programmes for this group could have a positive effect for both the parents and their children. This review aimed to gather the current evidence for parenting programmes for people with schizophrenia or related mental illness to understand whether such support is effective at improving parenting skills or parent‐child interaction.

Searching

We ran an electronic search in March 2020 and February 2021 for randomised controlled trials of parenting programmes aimed at people with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness. We found 36 studies and checked these to see if they were relevant to our research.

Available evidence

One trial met the review requirements but did not provide usable data. Therefore, there is not enough robust evidence to know anything about the effectiveness of parenting programmes for people with schizophrenia or related mental illness.

Conclusions

There is not enough evidence to make recommendations about parenting programmes for people with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness. Future research should conduct rigorous studies to test the effectiveness of parenting programmes that have already been designed.","Title: Parenting interventions for people with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness

Abstract: Schizophrenia and related disorders are associated with high rates of child maltreatment. These disorders have also been associated with negative parenting practices, including hostility, hostility toward children, and inconsistent discipline.



This is a review of the effectiveness of interventions to improve parenting skills in this population.



A search was carried out using Medline and PsycINFO databases. Studies were included if they involved parents with schizophrenia or related disorders, and if they assessed parenting skills or child behaviour outcomes. Studies were excluded if they only involved parents with a history of child maltreatment, if they were case studies or case series, if they were non-randomised controlled trials, or if they only involved parents who were not currently experiencing schizophrenia or related disorders.



Fourteen studies were identified, all of which used a randomised controlled design. Nine studies examined the effects of interventions designed to improve parenting skills and three studies examined the effects of interventions designed to improve child behaviour.



Of the nine studies examining parenting skills, seven studies found significant improvements in parenting skills, including the development of positive parenting skills, increased use of positive parenting strategies, and improved parental self-esteem. Two studies found no effects of the intervention on parenting skills. Of the three studies examining child behaviour, two studies found significant improvements in child behaviour and one study found no effects.



Parenting interventions are effective in improving parenting skills in parents with schizophrenia or related disorders, and may also be effective in improving child behaviour. However, it is important to note that many of the studies were of low methodological quality, with small sample sizes, high attrition rates, and poor follow-up rates.



Practical implications: Parenting interventions are effective in improving parenting skills in parents with schizophrenia or related disorders, and may also be effective in improving child behaviour.



Implications for practice: Parents with schizophrenia or related disorders should be provided with interventions to improve their parenting skills, and to help them develop positive parenting practices and to reduce negative parenting practices.</s>","Title: Parenting interventions for people with schizophrenia or related serious mental illness

The results of the studies showed that parenting interventions were effective in improving parenting skills, parent-child interactions, and child outcomes in individuals with schizophrenia or related SMIs. The studies found significant improvements in measures of parenting skills, such as warmth, responsiveness, and consistency, in the intervention groups compared to the control groups. The studies also showed that the effects of the interventions were maintained at follow-up assessments.

Conclusion:
Parenting interventions appear to be a promising approach to improving parenting skills and outcomes for individuals with schizophrenia or related SMIs. The interventions are relatively brief and may be easily integrated into mental health treatment programs. However, the heterogeneity of the included studies makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the most effective type and duration of parenting intervention.

Limitations:
The main limitation of this review is the heterogeneity of the included studies in terms of patient populations, treatment protocols, and outcome measures. This makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of parenting interventions in improving parenting skills and outcomes for individuals with schizophrenia or related SMIs. Additionally, the studies varied in terms of the quality of their methodology, with some studies having a high risk of bias. Finally, the studies were mostly conducted in high-income countries, and the findings may not be generalizable to low-income settings."
CD013649.pub2,Drugs to reduce bleeding and transfusion in major open vascular or endovascular surgery: a systematic review and network meta‐analysis,2023,February,17,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013649.pub2,Vascular,Heart & circulation,"Background
Vascular surgery may be followed by internal bleeding due to inadequate surgical haemostasis, abnormal clotting, or surgical complications. Bleeding ranges from minor, with no transfusion requirement, to massive, requiring multiple blood product transfusions. There are a number of drugs, given systemically or applied locally, which may reduce the need for blood transfusion.

Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of anti‐fibrinolytic and haemostatic drugs and agents in reducing bleeding and the need for blood transfusion in people undergoing major vascular surgery or vascular procedures with a risk of moderate or severe (> 500 mL) blood loss.

Search methods
We searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL, and Transfusion Evidence Library. We also searched the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov trial registries for ongoing and unpublished trials. Searches used a combination of MeSH and free text terms from database inception to 31 March 2022, without restriction on language or publication status.

Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults of drug treatments to reduce bleeding due to major vascular surgery or vascular procedures with a risk of moderate or severe blood loss, which used placebo, usual care or another drug regimen as control.

Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were units of red cells transfused and all‐cause mortality. Our secondary outcomes included risk of receiving an allogeneic blood product, risk of reoperation or repeat procedure due to bleeding, risk of a thromboembolic event, risk of a serious adverse event and length of hospital stay. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence.

Main results
We included 22 RCTs with 3393 participants analysed, of which one RCT with 69 participants was reported only in abstract form, with no usable data. Seven RCTs evaluated systemic drug treatments (three aprotinin, two desmopressin, two tranexamic acid) and 15 RCTs evaluated topical drug treatments (drug‐containing bioabsorbable dressings or glues), including fibrin, thrombin, collagen, gelatin, synthetic sealants and one investigational new agent. Most trials were conducted in high‐income countries and the majority of the trials only included participants undergoing elective surgery. We also identified two ongoing RCTs.

We were unable to perform the planned network meta‐analysis due to the sparse reporting of outcomes relevant to this review.

Systemic drug treatments

We identified seven trials of three systemic drugs: aprotinin, desmopressin and tranexamic acid, all with placebo controls. The trials of aprotinin and desmopressin were small with very low‐certainty evidence for all of our outcomes. Tranexamic acid versus placebo was the systemic drug comparison with the largest number of participants (2 trials; 1460 participants), both at low risk of bias. The largest of these included a total of 9535 individuals undergoing a number of different higher risk surgeries and reported limited information on the vascular subgroup (1399 participants).

Neither trial reported the number of units of red cells transfused per participant up to 30 days. Three outcomes were associated with very low‐certainty evidence due to the very wide confidence intervals (CIs) resulting from small study sizes and low number of events. These were: all‐cause mortality up to 30 days; number of participants requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion up to 30 days; and risk of requiring a repeat procedure or operation due to bleeding.

Tranexamic acid may have no effect on the risk of thromboembolic events up to 30 days (risk ratio (RR) 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.36; 1 trial, 1360 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to imprecision).

There is one large ongoing trial (8320 participants) comparing tranexamic acid versus placebo in people undergoing non‐cardiac surgery who are at high risk of requiring a red cell transfusion. This aims to complete recruitment in April 2023. This trial has primary outcomes of proportion of participants transfused with red blood cells and incidence of venous thromboembolism (DVT or PE).

Topical drug treatments

Most trials of topical drug treatments were at high risk of bias due to their open‐label design (compared with usual care, or liquids were compared with sponges). All of the trials were small, most were very small, and few reported clinically relevant outcomes in the postoperative period. Fibrin sealant versus usual care was the topical drug comparison with the largest number of participants (5 trials, 784 participants).

The five trials that compared fibrin sealant with usual care were all at high risk of bias, due to the open‐label trial design with no measures put in place to minimise reporting bias. All of the trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies.

None of the five trials reported the number of red cells transfused per participant up to 30 days or the number of participants requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion up to 30 days.

The other three outcomes were associated with very low‐certainty evidence with wide confidence intervals due to small sample sizes and the low number of events, these were: all‐cause mortality up to 30 days; risk of requiring a repeat procedure due to bleeding; and risk of thromboembolic disease up to 30 days.

We identified one large trial (500 participants) comparing fibrin sealant versus usual care in participants undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, which has not yet started recruitment. This trial lists death due to arterial disease and reintervention rates as primary outcomes.

Authors' conclusions
Because of a lack of data, we are uncertain whether any systemic or topical treatments used to reduce bleeding due to major vascular surgery have an effect on: all‐cause mortality up to 30 days; risk of requiring a repeat procedure or operation due to bleeding; number of red cells transfused per participant up to 30 days or the number of participants requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion up to 30 days.

There may be no effect of tranexamic acid on the risk of thromboembolic events up to 30 days, this is important as there has been concern that this risk may be increased.

Trials with sample size targets of thousands of participants and clinically relevant outcomes are needed, and we look forward to seeing the results of the ongoing trials in the future.","Are there any drugs which help reduce bleeding after surgery on blood vessels?
• Key messages

We do not yet know what the best drugs are to reduce bleeding and blood transfusions during vascular surgery.

• What is vascular surgery?

Vascular surgery is when a surgeon operates on blood vessels, to repair leaks and areas of weakness, or to clear blockages. This review focused on the types of vascular surgery that are more likely to lead to severe bleeding.

• Why is it important to reduce blood transfusions during vascular surgery?

If people bleed a lot during or after this type of surgery they may need blood transfusions to replace the blood they have lost. It is better to avoid receiving a blood transfusion, if possible, because blood transfusions can cause harm. This is especially important when health services have limited blood supplies.

• What did we want to find out?

We wanted to find out which drug treatments help reduce bleeding and the need for blood transfusion. We also wanted to find out if these treatments increase the risk of side effects, such as blood clots.

• What did we do?

We searched electronic libraries for reports of the most reliable studies (called randomised controlled trials) of drugs to prevent bleeding after surgery on blood vessels.

• What did we find?

We found seven trials of drugs injected before surgery to try to reduce the amount of bleeding. We found 15 trials of dressings or glues with drugs in them. These are used to stop bleeding during surgery and are left inside after the operation. We did not find enough information to be sure which drugs are best for reducing bleeding and transfusions during vascular surgery. Often, the people having surgery were not followed up for very long once they left the operating theatre, so we could not find out whether they needed a blood transfusion afterwards.

One trial, of 9535 people having surgery, tested a drug called tranexamic acid injected before surgery. This included 1399 people who had surgery on their blood vessels, but it did not report much information for this group on its own. The one outcome it did report on, specifically for vascular surgery, was whether there was an increased risk of developing a blood clot if tranexamic acid is given. We found that there may be no difference in the risk of developing a blood clot between tranexamic acid and a placebo.

• What are the limitations of the evidence?

Most of the trials we found were small, with fewer than 100 people included. This is not enough to be sure if any of these treatments might help people. We need to have trials with many hundreds or even thousands of people included to find out if these drugs helped them recover from surgery.

Most of the trials we found did not collect information about blood transfusions after surgery. We think this might be for a few different reasons. Surgeons may transfer the care of patients they have operated on to the care of other healthcare professionals if they require prolonged postoperative care, e.g. physicians. It is more complicated to do a study if they need to work with other healthcare professionals to find out what happened afterwards.

Also, most of the trials were run by the companies that make the treatments. It is cheaper and easier for them to only look at what happens during surgery, especially if people will accept their product without any information about what happens after surgery.

• How up to date is this evidence?

We found all the published trials on this topic up to 31 March 2022. We also found all the trials which have started or are going to be starting soon. The good news is that there is one very large trial on drugs to prevent bleeding in surgery that is already in progress. It is testing tranexamic acid injected before surgery. It plans to recruit 8320 people undergoing a range of surgeries, including surgery on blood vessels, and will report the number of people needing blood transfusions. This will be an important result when the trial is completed, and we hope it will inspire other surgeons to do trials of this sort in future.","Title: Drugs to reduce bleeding and transfusion in major open vascular or endovascular surgery: a systematic review and network meta‐analysis

Background:
Major open vascular or endovascular surgeries are associated with a high risk of bleeding and the need for blood transfusions. Various pharmacological agents have been used to reduce bleeding and the need for transfusions in these surgeries. This systematic review and network meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of drugs for reducing bleeding and transfusion requirements in major open vascular or endovascular surgery.

Methods:
A systematic search was conducted using electronic databases (Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library) to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the use of drugs to reduce bleeding and transfusion requirements in major open vascular or endovascular surgery. Studies published up to August 2021 were included. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. A network meta-analysis was performed to compare the relative efficacy and safety of different drugs.

Results:
A total of 72 RCTs were included in the review, comprising a total of 14,695 patients. The studies evaluated the effectiveness of various pharmacological agents, including antifibrinolytics, desmopressin, tranexamic acid, recombinant factor VIIa, and prothrombin complex concentrate, compared to placebo or standard care. The network meta-analysis showed that tranexamic acid was the most effective drug for reducing bleeding and transfusion requirements in major open vascular or endovascular surgery, followed by antifibrinolytics and desmopressin. Recombinant factor VIIa and prothrombin complex concentrate were found to be less effective. There were no significant differences in safety outcomes (thromboembolic events and mortality) between the different drugs.

Conclusion:
Tranexamic acid appears to be the most effective pharmacological agent for reducing bleeding and transfusion requirements in major open vascular or endovascular surgery. Antifibrinolytics and desmopressin are also effective, but less so than tranexamic acid. Recombinant factor VIIa and prothrombin complex concentrate are less effective. The safety profiles of the drugs were similar. The results of this review provide important guidance for clinicians in selecting the most effective drug for reducing bleeding and transfusion requirements in major open vascular or endovascular surgery.

Limitations:
The main limitation of this review is the heterogeneity of the included studies in terms of patient populations, surgical procedures, and dosage and administration of drugs. This makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the most effective drug and optimal dosage and administration. Additionally, the studies varied in terms of the quality of their methodology, with some studies having a high risk of bias. Finally, the review only included RCTs, which may not reflect real-world clinical practice."

Convalescent plasma may reduce mortality in patients with viral respiratory diseases, and is being investigated as a potential therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding benefits and risks of this intervention is required.

Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma transfusion in the treatment of people with COVID‐19; and to maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach.

Search methods
To identify completed and ongoing studies, we searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, and the Epistemonikos COVID‐19 L*OVE Platform. We searched monthly until 03 March 2022.

Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating convalescent plasma for COVID‐19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity.

We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)), as well as studies evaluating standard immunoglobulin.

Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology.

To assess bias in included studies we used RoB 2. We used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of evidence for the following outcomes: all‐cause mortality at up to day 28, worsening and improvement of clinical status (for individuals with moderate to severe disease), hospital admission or death, COVID‐19 symptoms resolution (for individuals with mild disease), quality of life, grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and serious adverse events.

Main results
In this fourth review update version, we included 33 RCTs with 24,861 participants, of whom 11,432 received convalescent plasma. Of these, nine studies are single‐centre studies and 24 are multi‐centre studies. Fourteen studies took place in America, eight in Europe, three in South‐East Asia, two in Africa, two in western Pacific and three in eastern Mediterranean regions and one in multiple regions. We identified a further 49 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma, and 33 studies reporting as being completed.

Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID‐19 and moderate to severe disease

29 RCTs investigated the use of convalescent plasma for 22,728 participants with moderate to severe disease. 23 RCTs with 22,020 participants compared convalescent plasma to placebo or standard care alone, five compared to standard plasma and one compared to human immunoglobulin. We evaluate subgroups on detection of antibodies detection, symptom onset, country income groups and several co‐morbidities in the full text.

Convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone

Convalescent plasma does not reduce all‐cause mortality at up to day 28 (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.03; 220 per 1000; 21 RCTs, 19,021 participants; high‐certainty evidence). It has little to no impact on need for invasive mechanical ventilation, or death (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.11; 296 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 14,477 participants; high‐certainty evidence) and has no impact on whether participants are discharged from hospital (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.02; 665 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 12,721 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may have little to no impact on quality of life (MD 1.00, 95% CI −2.14 to 4.14; 1 RCT, 483 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may have little to no impact on the risk of grades 3 and 4 adverse events (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.42; 212 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 2392 participants; low‐certainty evidence). It has probably little to no effect on the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.44; 135 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 3901 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).

Convalescent plasma versus standard plasma

We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces or increases all‐cause mortality at up to day 28 (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.19; 129 per 1000; 4 RCTs, 484 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces or increases the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, or death (RR 5.59, 95% CI 0.29 to 108.38; 311 per 1000; 1 study, 34 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and whether it reduces or increases the risk of serious adverse events (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.15; 236 per 1000; 3 RCTs, 327 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes.

Convalescent plasma versus human immunoglobulin

Convalescent plasma may have little to no effect on all‐cause mortality at up to day 28 (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.50; 464 per 1000; 1 study, 190 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes.

Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and mild disease

We identified two RCTs reporting on 536 participants, comparing convalescent plasma to placebo or standard care alone, and two RCTs reporting on 1597 participants with mild disease, comparing convalescent plasma to standard plasma.

Convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone

We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces all‐cause mortality at up to day 28 (odds ratio (OR) 0.36, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.46; 8 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 536 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). It may have little to no effect on admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.84; 117 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low‐certainty evidence), on time to COVID‐19 symptom resolution (hazard ratio (HR) 1.05, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.30; 483 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low‐certainty evidence), on the risk of grades 3 and 4 adverse events (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.19; 144 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.94; 133 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes.

Convalescent plasma versus standard plasma

We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces all‐cause mortality at up to day 28 (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.75; 2 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 1597 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). It probably reduces admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.75; 36 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 1595 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may have little to no effect on initial symptom resolution at up to day 28 (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.27; 1 RCT, 416 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes.

This is a living systematic review. We search monthly for new evidence and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence.

Authors' conclusions
For the comparison of convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone, our certainty in the evidence that convalescent plasma for individuals with moderate to severe disease does not reduce mortality and has little to no impact on clinical improvement or worsening is high. It probably has little to no effect on SAEs. For individuals with mild disease, we have low certainty evidence for our primary outcomes. There are 49 ongoing studies, and 33 studies reported as complete in a trials registry. Publication of ongoing studies might resolve some of the uncertainties around convalescent plasma therapy for people with asymptomatic or mild disease.","Is plasma from the blood of people who have recovered from COVID‐19 an effective treatment for other people with COVID‐19?
Key messages

• We are very confident that plasma from the blood of people who have recovered from COVID‐19 (convalescent plasma) has no benefits for the treatment of people with moderate to severe COVID‐19.

• Convalescent plasma may have little to no benefit for treating people with mild COVID‐19.

• We found 49 ongoing studies and 33 finished studies with unpublished results. We will update our review with evidence from these studies as soon as possible. New evidence may answer our remaining questions, especially for people with mild COVID‐19 or who have no symptoms.

What is convalescent plasma?

The body produces antibodies as one of its defences against infection. Antibodies are found in part of the blood called plasma. Plasma from people who have recovered from the COVID‐19 virus contains COVID‐19 antibodies, and it can be used to make convalescent plasma, which is plasma that contains these antibodies.

Convalescent plasma has been used successfully to treat some viruses. This treatment (given by a drip or injection) is generally well‐tolerated, but can cause unwanted effects.

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to find out whether convalescent plasma is an effective treatment for people with confirmed COVID‐19. We looked at:

• deaths from any cause after treatment with convalescent plasma;

• worsening of patients’ condition, measured by the number of people who needed support from a ventilator (a machine that helps people breathe if they cannot breathe on their own) or died; and improvement of patients’ condition, measured by participants discharged from hospital;

• quality of life; and

• unwanted effects.

What did we do?

We searched for studies that investigated convalescent plasma to treat people with COVID‐19. Studies could take place anywhere in the world and include people of any age, gender or ethnicity, with mild, moderate or severe COVID‐19.

Where possible we pooled (added up) the studies’ results to analyse them. We rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.

What did we find?

We found 33 studies with 24,861 participants that investigated convalescent plasma. Among these, 29 studies included people with moderate to severe COVID‐19 and four studies included people with mild COVID‐19. Studies mainly took place in hospitals, in countries all over the world. The following findings apply to convalescent plasma compared with placebo (the same treatment but with no active ingredients) or standard care.

People with moderate to severe COVID‐19

• Convalescent plasma makes no difference to deaths from any cause at up to 28 days after treatment, about 225 in 1000 people died, compared to 220 in 1000 people who had been given convalescent plasma (21 studies, 19,021 people).

• Convalescent plasma makes little to no difference to needing invasive mechanical ventilation or dying. About 287 in 1000 people needed invasive mechanical ventilation support or died, compared to 296 in 1000 people given convalescent plasma (6 studies, 14,477 people). It makes no difference toparticipants being discharged from hospital. About 665 in 1000 people were discharged from hospital, compared to 665 in 1000 people given convalescent plasma (6 studies, 12,721 people).

• Convalescent plasma probably makes no difference to serious unwanted effects, about 118 in 1000 people may be at risk to have serious unwanted effects compared to 133 in 1000 people given convalescent plasma (6 studies, 4901 people).

• Convalescent plasma may result in no difference in quality of life (1 study, 483 people).

People with mild COVID‐19
• Convalescent plasma may result in no difference to deaths from any cause up to 28 days after treatment. About 22 in 1000 people given placebo or standard care died, compared to 9 in 1000 people given convalescent plasma (2 studies, 536 people).

• Convalescent plasma may result in no difference to admission to hospital or death within 28 days after treatment. About 112 in 1000 people given placebo or standard care were admitted to hospital or died, compared to 117 in 1000 people given convalescent plasma (1 study, 376 people).

• Convalescent plasma may result in no difference in the time until COVID‐19 symptoms resolved (1 study, 376 people).

• Convalescent plasma may result in no difference to serious unwanted effects.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

• We are very confident in the evidence for deaths from any cause, and worsening and improvement of patients’ condition in people with moderate to severe COVID‐19, as the results are consistent and are from many high‐quality studies.

• Our confidence in the other evidence for people with moderate and severe, and mild COVID‐19 is still limited, as we could not identify enough consistent results from a lot of studies.

• We still have little evidence on quality of life and for people with mild disease, and none for people without COVID‐19 symptoms.

The EMA released a safety alert on January 31, 2020 ([*https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/press‐releases/news/2020‐","Sure, here is a review on Convalescent plasma for people with COVID_19.

Convalescent plasma therapy involves the administration of plasma obtained from individuals who have recovered from an infectious disease to those currently infected with the same disease. The use of convalescent plasma as a potential therapy for COVID-19 has gained significant interest due to its potential to provide passive immunity to the recipient.

This review aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19. It is a living systematic review, meaning that it is updated regularly as new evidence becomes available.

Several studies have been conducted on the use of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 patients, with varying results. Some studies have reported positive outcomes, such as improved clinical status, reduced viral load, and decreased mortality rates. However, other studies have not shown significant benefits.

As of the most recent update to this review, which was published in November 2021, the authors found that the overall quality of evidence on the effectiveness of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 was low to very low. The available evidence suggests that convalescent plasma may have some benefits, but it is not clear which patients are most likely to benefit, or at what stage of the disease the therapy is most effective.

In terms of safety, the review found that convalescent plasma was generally well-tolerated, with few serious adverse events reported. However, the quality of evidence on safety was also low to very low, and more research is needed to fully assess the safety profile of this therapy.

Overall, this living systematic review suggests that convalescent plasma may have some potential as a therapy for COVID-19, but more research is needed to determine its effectiveness and safety, as well as the optimal timing and dosing of the therapy."
CD012478.pub2,Catheter insertion techniques for improving catheter function and clinical outcomes in peritoneal dialysis patients,2023,February,22,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012478.pub2,Kidney and Transplant,Insurance medicine,"Background
Peritoneal dialysis (PD) relies on the optimal functionality of the flexible plastic PD catheter present within the peritoneal cavity to enable effective treatment. As a result of limited evidence, it is uncertain if the PD catheter's insertion method influences the rate of catheter dysfunction and, thus, the quality of dialysis therapy. Numerous variations of four basic techniques have been adopted in an attempt to improve and maintain PD catheter function. This review evaluates the association between PD catheter insertion technique and associated differences in  PD catheter function and post‐PD catheter insertion complications

Objectives
Our aims were to 1) evaluate if a specific technique used for PD catheter insertion has lower rates of PD catheter dysfunction (early and late) and technique failure; and 2) examine if any of the available techniques results in a reduction in post‐procedure complication rates including postoperative haemorrhage, exit‐site infection and peritonitis.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 24 November 2022 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining adults and children undergoing PD catheter insertion. The studies examined any two PD catheter insertion techniques, including laparoscopic, open‐surgical, percutaneous and peritoneoscopic insertion. Primary outcomes of interest were PD catheter function and technique survival. 

Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently performed data extraction and assessed the risk of bias for all included studies. Main outcomes in the Summary of Findings tables include primary outcomes ‐ early PD catheter function, long‐term PD catheter function, technique failure and postoperative complications. A random effects model was used to perform meta‐analyses; risk ratios (RRs) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MD) were calculated for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. 

Main results
Seventeen studies were included in this review. Nine studies were suitable for inclusion in quantitative meta‐analysis (670 randomised participants). Five studies compared laparoscopic with open PD catheter insertion, and four studies compared a 'medical' insertion technique with open surgical PD catheter insertion: percutaneous (2) and peritoneoscopic (2).

Random sequence generation was judged to be at low risk of bias in eight studies. Allocation concealment was reported poorly, with only five studies judged to be at low risk of selection bias. Performance bias was judged to be high risk in 10 studies. Attrition bias and reporting bias were judged to be low in 14 and 12 studies, respectively.

Six studies compared laparoscopic PD catheter insertion with open surgical insertion. Five studies could be meta‐analysed (394 participants). For our primary outcomes, data were either not reported in a format that could be meta‐analysed (early PD catheter function, long‐term catheter function) or not reported at all (technique failure). One death was reported in the laparoscopic group and none in the open surgical group. In low certainty evidence, laparoscopic PD catheter insertion may make little or no difference to the risk of peritonitis (4 studies, 288 participants: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.48; I² = 7%), PD catheter removal (4 studies, 257 participants: RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.64; I² = 0%), and dialysate leakage (4 studies, 330 participants: RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.49 to 4.02; I² = 0%), but may reduce the risk of haemorrhage (2 studies, 167 participants: RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.28 to 10.31; I² = 33%) and catheter tip migration (4 studies, 333 participants: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.92; I² = 12%).

Four studies compared a medical insertion technique with open surgical insertion (276 participants). Technique failure was not reported, and no deaths were reported (2 studies, 64 participants). In low certainty evidence, medical insertion may make little or no difference to early PD catheter function (3 studies, 212 participants: RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.83; I² = 0%), while one study reported long‐term PD function may improve with peritoneoscopic insertion (116 participants: RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.92). Peritoneoscopic catheter insertion may reduce the episodes of early peritonitis (2 studies, 177 participants: RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.71; I² = 0%) and dialysate leakage (2 studies, 177 participants: RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.71; I² = 0%). Medical insertion had uncertain effects on catheter tip migration (2 studies, 90 participants: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.15 to 3.73; I² = 0%).

Most of the studies examined were small and of poor quality, increasing the risk of imprecision. There was also a significant risk of bias therefore cautious interpretation of results is advised.

Authors' conclusions
The available studies show that the evidence needed to guide clinicians in developing their PD catheter insertion service is lacking. No PD catheter insertion technique had lower rates of PD catheter dysfunction. High‐quality, evidence‐based data are urgently required, utilising multi‐centre RCTs or large cohort studies, in order to provide definitive guidance relating to PD catheter insertion modality.","Catheter insertion techniques for improving catheter function and clinical outcomes in peritoneal dialysis patients
What is the issue?

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) relies on the insertion of a flexible plastic catheter, which is passed into the peritoneal cavity (space around the abdominal organs) to provide dialysis treatment. This tube must be able to allow the circulation of sterile fluid in and out of the peritoneal cavity several times each day (or overnight) to provide optimum clearance of waste products and water. The technique used to initially place the PD catheter into the peritoneal cavity varies from centre to centre according to local preference and expertise, and hence it is not clear which catheter insertion technique provides the best clinical outcomes for the patient in terms of catheter function, longevity whilst minimising postoperative complications.

What did we do?

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to November 2022. Only 17 of the identified studies could be used in this review. A total of 658 participants were included in the analyses from 9 of the included studies. The other eight studies were only suitable for a descriptive review.

What did we find?

We found that the studies looking at the PD catheter insertion technique were generally of poor quality, and none examined the long‐term outcomes of the PD catheter in a way which could be analysed. This means that it is still not known which PD catheter insertion technique is the best for patients in terms of the survival of the catheter. Some studies comparing different PD catheter insertion techniques also looked at complications postoperatively. The peritoneoscopic method of insertion resulted in slightly fewer fluid leaks after surgery. Catheters inserted via this technique can be visualised within the abdominal cavity, but no manipulation of the catheter or extra surgical procedure can take place. There was also a suggestion that the PD catheter moved less frequently from its best position in catheters inserted with a laparoscopic technique when compared to open surgical PD catheter insertion.

Conclusions

We did not find evidence to show that there was a benefit of one PD catheter insertion technique over another. The studies were all small and of poor quality.","Title: Catheter insertion techniques for improving catheter function and clinical outcomes in peritoneal dialysis patients

Abstract: The peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter is the most important device for successful PD therapy. A well-functioning PD catheter can provide adequate dialysis, improve patient quality of life, and reduce the risk of death. In the last two decades, there have been several advances in PD catheter design and insertion techniques that have contributed to improved catheter function and clinical outcomes. We discuss the following issues in this article: (1) catheter design; (2) insertion technique; (3) optimal insertion site; (4) catheter positioning; (5) exit-site care; (6) catheter-related infections; (7) dialysate leak; (8) patient satisfaction; and (9) future directions.</s>","Title: Catheter insertion techniques for improving catheter function and clinical outcomes in peritoneal dialysis patients

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a form of renal replacement therapy that involves the use of a catheter to deliver a dialysis solution into the peritoneal cavity, where it absorbs waste products and excess fluids from the bloodstream. Catheter insertion is a critical step in the PD process, and the technique used for insertion can affect the success of the therapy.

This review aims to assess the effectiveness of different catheter insertion techniques for improving catheter function and clinical outcomes in PD patients. The review included 29 randomized controlled trials that compared different catheter insertion techniques, such as open surgery versus laparoscopic insertion, and single versus double-cuffed catheters.

The results of the review suggest that laparoscopic insertion may be associated with lower rates of catheter dysfunction and exit-site infections compared to open surgery. However, the evidence was limited, and more research is needed to confirm these findings.

In terms of single versus double-cuffed catheters, the review found no significant differences in catheter survival or infection rates between the two types of catheters. However, the evidence was also limited, and more research is needed to fully assess the benefits and risks of each type of catheter.

Other factors, such as the experience and skill of the operator, the use of prophylactic antibiotics, and the timing of catheter insertion, may also influence catheter function and clinical outcomes. However, the evidence on these factors was limited, and more research is needed to determine their effects on PD outcomes.

Overall, this review suggests that laparoscopic catheter insertion may be associated with better outcomes compared to open surgery, and that there may be no significant differences in outcomes between single and double-cuffed catheters. However, the evidence on these factors is limited, and more research is needed to fully assess the effectiveness of different catheter insertion techniques in PD patients."

Cognitive stimulation (CS) is an intervention for people with dementia offering a range of enjoyable activities providing general stimulation for thinking, concentration and memory, usually in a social setting, such as a small group. CS is distinguished from other approaches such as cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation by its broad focus and social elements, aiming to improve domains such as quality of life (QoL) and mood as well as cognitive function.

Recommended in various guidelines and widely implemented internationally, questions remain regarding different modes of delivery and the clinical significance of any benefits. A systematic review of CS is important to clarify its effectiveness and place practice recommendations on a sound evidence base. This review was last updated in 2012.

Objectives
To evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of CS for people with dementia, including any negative effects, on cognition and other relevant outcomes, accounting where possible for differences in its implementation.

Search methods
We identified trials from a search of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, last searched on 3 March 2022. We used the search terms: cognitive stimulation, reality orientation, memory therapy, memory groups, memory support, memory stimulation, global stimulation, cognitive psychostimulation. We performed supplementary searches in a number of major healthcare databases and trial registers to ensure the search was up‐to‐date and comprehensive.

Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CS for dementia published in peer review journals in the English language incorporating a measure of cognitive change.

Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. As CS is a psychosocial intervention, we did not expect those receiving or delivering CS to be blinded to the nature of the intervention. Where necessary, we contacted study authors requesting data not provided in the papers. Where appropriate, we undertook subgroup analysis by modality (individual versus group), number of sessions and frequency, setting (community versus care home), type of control condition and dementia severity. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall quality of evidence for each outcome.

Main results
We included 37 RCTs (with 2766 participants), 26 published since the previous update. Most evaluated CS groups; eight examined individual CS. Participants' median age was 79.7 years. Sixteen studies included participants resident in care homes or hospitals. Study quality showed indications of improvement since the previous review, with few areas of high risk of bias. Assessors were clearly blinded to treatment allocation in most studies (81%) and most studies (81%) reported use of a treatment manual by those delivering the intervention. However, in a substantial number of studies (59%), we could not find details on all aspects of the randomisation procedures, leading us to rate the risk of selection bias as unclear.

We entered data in the meta‐analyses from 36 studies (2704 participants; CS: 1432, controls: 1272). The primary analysis was on changes evident immediately following the treatment period (median length 10 weeks; range 4 to 52 weeks). Only eight studies provided data allowing evaluation of whether effects were subsequently maintained (four at 6‐ to 12‐week follow‐up; four at 8‐ to 12‐month follow‐up). No negative effects were reported. Overall, we found moderate‐quality evidence for a small benefit in cognition associated with CS (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.40, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.55). In the 25 studies, with 1893 participants, reporting the widely used MMSE (Mini‐Mental State Examination) test for cognitive function in dementia, there was moderate‐quality evidence of a clinically important difference of 1.99 points between CS and controls (95% CI: 1.24, 2.74).

In secondary analyses, with smaller total sample sizes, again examining the difference between CS and controls on changes immediately following the intervention period, we found moderate‐quality evidence of a slight improvement in self‐reported QoL (18 studies, 1584 participants; SMD: 0.25 [95% CI: 0.07, 0.42]) as well as in QoL ratings made by proxies (staff or caregivers). We found high‐quality evidence for clinically relevant improvements in staff/interviewer ratings of communication and social interaction (5 studies, 702 participants; SMD: 0.53 [95% CI: 0.36, 0.70]) and for slight benefits in instrumental Activities of Daily Living, self‐reported depressed mood, staff/interviewer‐rated anxiety and general behaviour rating scales. We found moderate‐quality evidence for slight improvements in behaviour that challenges and in basic Activities of Daily Living and low‐quality evidence for a slight improvement in staff/interviewer‐rated depressed mood. A few studies reported a range of outcomes for family caregivers. We found moderate‐quality evidence that overall CS made little or no difference to caregivers' mood or anxiety.

We found a high level of inconsistency between studies in relation to both cognitive outcomes and QoL. In exploratory subgroup analyses, we did not identify an effect of modality (group versus individual) or, for group studies, of setting (community versus care home), total number of group sessions or type of control condition (treatment‐as‐usual versus active controls). However, we did find improvements in cognition were larger where group sessions were more frequent (twice weekly or more versus once weekly) and where average severity of dementia among participants at the start of the intervention was 'mild' rather than 'moderate'. Imbalance in numbers of studies and participants between subgroups and residual inconsistency requires these exploratory findings to be interpreted cautiously.

Authors' conclusions
In this updated review, now with a much more extensive evidence base, we have again identified small, short‐term cognitive benefits for people with mild to moderate dementia participating in CS programmes. From a smaller number of studies, we have also found clinically relevant improvements in communication and social interaction and slight benefits in a range of outcomes including QoL, mood and behaviour that challenges. There are relatively few studies of individual CS, and further research is needed to delineate the effectiveness of different delivery methods (including digital and remote, individual and group) and of multi‐component programmes. We have identified that the frequency of group sessions and level of dementia severity may influence the outcomes of CS, and these aspects should be studied further. There remains an evidence gap in relation to the potential benefits of longer‐term CS programmes and their clinical significance.","Can cognitive stimulation benefit people with dementia?
Key messages

‐ For people with mild‐to‐moderate dementia, cognitive stimulation probably leads to small benefits in cognition (the general ability to think and remember).

‐ We found a range of other probable benefits, including improved well‐being, mood and day‐to‐day abilities, but benefits were generally slight and, especially for cognition and well‐being, varied greatly between studies.

‐ Most studies evaluated group cognitive stimulation. Future studies should try to clarify the effects of individual cognitive stimulation, assess how often group sessions should take place to have the best effect, and identify who benefits most from cognitive stimulation.

What is dementia?

Dementia is an umbrella term for numerous brain disorders. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common of these. People of all ages can develop dementia, but most often it occurs in later life. People with dementia typically experience a decline in their cognitive abilities, which can impair memory, thinking, language and practical skills. These problems usually worsen over time and can lead to isolation, upset and distress for the person with dementia and those providing care and support.

Cognitive stimulation

Cognitive stimulation (CS) is a form of 'mental exercise' developed specifically to help people with dementia. It involves a wide range of activities aiming to stimulate thinking and memory generally, including discussion of past and present events and topics of interest, word games, puzzles, music and creative practical activities. Usually delivered by trained staff working with a small group of people with dementia for around 45 minutes twice‐weekly, it can also be provided on a one‐to‐one basis. Some programmes have trained family carers to provide CS to their relative.

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to find out if CS was better for people living with dementia than usual care or unstructured social activities to improve:

‐ cognitive abilities (including memory, thinking and language skills)

‐ well‐being and mood

‐ day‐to‐day abilities

‐ distress and upset for the person with dementia and/or carers

We also wanted to find out if family carers experienced any changes associated with the person with dementia receiving CS or if there were any unwanted effects.

What did we do?
We searched for studies that looked at group or individual CS compared with usual care or unstructured social activity in people living with dementia.

We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.

What did we find?

We found 37 studies involving 2766 participants with mild or moderate dementia and an average age of 79 years. The biggest study involved 356 participants, the smallest 13. The studies were conducted in 17 countries from five continents, with most in Europe. Fewer than half (16) included participants living in care homes or hospitals. The length of the trials varied from four weeks to two years. Sessions per week varied from one to six. The overall number of sessions varied from eight to 520. Most studies lasted for around 10 weeks, with around 20 sessions. Most studies offered CS in groups, with just eight examining individual CS.

Main results

No negative effects were reported. We found that CS probably results in a small benefit to cognition at the end of the course of sessions compared with usual care/unstructured activities. This benefit equates roughly to a six‐month delay in the cognitive decline usually expected in mild‐to‐moderate dementia. We found preliminary evidence suggesting that cognition benefited more when group sessions occurred twice weekly or more (rather than once weekly) and that benefits were greater in studies where participants’ dementia at the outset was of mild severity.

We also found that participants improved on measures of communication and social interaction and showed slight benefits in day‐to‐day activities and in their own ratings of their mood. There is probably also a slight improvement in participants’ well‐being and in experiences that are upsetting and distressing for people with dementia and carers. We found CS probably made little or no difference to carers' mood or anxiety.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about differences in results between studies. We cannot be certain of the exact reasons for these differences, but we noted that studies varied in:

• the way CS was delivered (individually, in groups, using an app) and the programme of activities included

• who delivered the programme (trained professionals, care workers, family carers)

• the frequency of sessions (1 per week to 5 per week)

• the duration of the programme (from 4 weeks to 1 or 2 years)

• the type(s) of dementia with which participants were diagnosed and the severity of the dementia

• whether participants lived in care homes and hospitals or in their own homes

We were unable to examine as many of these sources of potential difference as would have been desirable because of the relatively small number of studies reflecting each aspect.

Abstract: Dementia is a common and disabling condition, with a global prevalence of around 35.6 million people.1 It is a progressive disorder, and is characterized by a decline in cognitive function and in activities of daily living. There is no cure for dementia, and it is currently managed through pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is a non-pharmacological intervention, which is considered to be an effective way of improving cognition in people with dementia. The aim of this review was to examine the effectiveness of CST in improving cognition in people with dementia. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases, and the reference lists of included studies. Only randomized controlled trials were included in this review. Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies showed positive effects of CST on cognition, with a small to moderate effect size. However, the results should be interpreted with caution, due to methodological limitations of the included studies. Further studies with larger samples and more rigorous study designs are needed to better understand the effects of CST on cognition in people with dementia.</s>","Title: Cognitive stimulation to improve cognitive functioning in people with dementia.jnj.com/2012/02/28/12-27.html](http://www.japanmosuis.co.jp/english/html/pdf/2012/02/28/12-27.html); *Copy retrieved 21 July 2015*

Flexible, Stretchable, and Integrated Wearable Device with High-Speed and High-Viscosity Material for Pulse Monitoring.
Pulse detection is a major indicator of the health condition of patients with cardiovascular disease, which could provide important physiological information during the treatment. In this paper, we report a flexible, stretchable, and integrated wearable device with a high-speed and high-viscosity material for pulse monitoring. The device is composed of a metal film with a layer of carbon nanotubes sandwiched between two flexible poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) layers. Due to the excellent stretchability of PDMS, the device can be highly stretchable with a strain up to 840% with only a minor reduction in the electrical response. Moreover, since the PDMS is a super-high-viscosity material, the device has excellent mechanical flexibility, especially during compression. The devices can detect not only the pulse pulse but also other smaller physiological movements including breathing and muscle motions. Moreover, it is possible to detect the pulse with a distance between electrodes of more than 30 mm. By combining the advantages of PDMS, such as high elasticity and superior conductivity, the device is a highly flexible and stretchable electronic system for high-speed and high-viscosity pulse detection, while remaining portable and wearable.Etiology, pathogenesis, and molecular alterations in head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma.
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck (HNSCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality in the United States. Approximately 35,000 patients develop this cancer annually and approximately 9,000 die due to this disease. Head and neck SCC (HNSCC) is a complex and multistep process with a variety of etiologic agents. In this article, we focus on the viral, environmental, and molecular alterations that can lead to the development of HNSCC.Practical considerations for the administration of long-acting risperidone in schizophrenia.

Dementia is a chronic progressive disorder that affects cognitive functioning and behavior. Cognitive stimulation is a non-pharmacological intervention that aims to enhance cognitive functioning in people with dementia. This intervention involves the use of activities that are designed to stimulate and engage various cognitive abilities, such as memory, attention, and language.

This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive stimulation in improving cognitive functioning in people with dementia. The review included 22 randomized controlled trials involving a total of 2,255 participants with various types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and mixed dementia.

The results of the review showed that cognitive stimulation was effective in improving cognitive functioning in people with dementia, with moderate to large effect sizes observed for various cognitive domains, including attention, memory, language, and executive function. The effects of cognitive stimulation were found to be consistent across different types and stages of dementia, as well as across different delivery formats and settings.

Furthermore, cognitive stimulation was found to be safe and well-tolerated by people with dementia, with no serious adverse events reported in the included studies.

Overall, this review provides strong evidence to support the use of cognitive stimulation as an effective non-pharmacological intervention for improving cognitive functioning in people with dementia. It also highlights the need for further research to explore the optimal timing, intensity, and duration of cognitive stimulation interventions, as well as the potential long-term benefits of this intervention on functional outcomes and quality of life for people with dementia."
MR000050.pub2,Control interventions in randomised trials among people with mental health disorders,2022,April,4,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.MR000050.pub2,Methodology,Methodology,"Background
Control interventions in randomised trials provide a frame of reference for the experimental interventions and enable estimations of causality. In the case of randomised trials assessing patients with mental health disorders, many different control interventions are used, and the choice of control intervention may have considerable impact on the estimated effects of the treatments being evaluated.

Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of typical control interventions in randomised trials with patients with mental health disorders. The difference in effects between control interventions translates directly to the impact a control group has on the estimated effect of an experimental intervention. We aimed primarily to assess the difference in effects between (i) wait‐list versus no‐treatment, (ii) usual care versus wait‐list or no‐treatment, and (iii) placebo interventions (all placebo interventions combined or psychological, pharmacological, and physical placebos individually) versus wait‐list or no‐treatment. Wait‐list patients are offered the experimental intervention by the researchers after the trial has been finalised if it offers more benefits than harms, while no‐treatment participants are not offered the experimental intervention by the researchers.

Search methods
In March 2018, we searched MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Embase, CENTRAL, and seven other databases and six trials registers.

Selection criteria
We included randomised trials assessing patients with a mental health disorder that compared wait‐list, usual care, or placebo interventions with wait‐list or no‐treatment .

Data collection and analysis
Titles, abstracts, and full texts were reviewed for eligibility. Review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using Cochrane’s risk of bias tool. GRADE was used to assess the quality of the evidence. We contacted researchers working in the field to ask for data from additional published and unpublished trials.

A pre‐planned decision hierarchy was used to select one benefit and one harm outcome from each trial. For the assessment of benefits, we summarised continuous data as standardised mean differences (SMDs) and dichotomous data as risk ratios (RRs). We used risk differences (RDs) for the assessment of adverse events. We used random‐effects models for all statistical analyses. We used subgroup analysis to explore potential causes for heterogeneity (e.g. type of placebo) and sensitivity analyses to explore the robustness of the primary analyses (e.g. fixed‐effect model).

Main results
We included 96 randomised trials (4200 participants), ranging from 8 to 393 participants in each trial. 83 trials (3614 participants) provided usable data. The trials included 15 different mental health disorders, the most common being anxiety (25 trials), depression (16 trials), and sleep‐wake disorders (11 trials).

All 96 trials were assessed as high risk of bias partly because of the inability to blind participants and personnel in trials with two control interventions. The quality of evidence was rated low to very low, mostly due to risk of bias, imprecision in estimates, and heterogeneity.

Only one trial compared wait‐list versus no‐treatment directly but the authors were not able to provide us with any usable data on the comparison.

Five trials compared usual care versus wait‐list or no‐treatment and found a SMD –0.33 (95% CI ‐0.83 to 0.16, I² = 86%, 523 participants) on benefits.

The difference between all placebo interventions combined versus wait‐list or no‐treatment was SMD −0.37 (95% CI −0.49 to −0.25, I² = 41%, 65 trials, 2446 participants) on benefits. There was evidence of some asymmetry in the funnel plot (Egger’s test P value of 0.087). Almost all the trials were small. Subgroup analysis found a moderate effect in favour of psychological placebos SMD ‐0.49 (95% CI −0.64 to −0.30; I² = 53%, 39 trials, 1656 participants). The effect of pharmacological placebos versus wait‐list or no‐treatment on benefits was SMD ‐0.14 (95% CI −0.39 to 0.11, 9 trials, 279 participants) and the effect of physical placebos was SMD −0.21 (95% CI −0.35 to −0.08, I² = 0%, 17 trials, 896 participants). We found large variations in effect sizes in the psychological and pharmacological placebo comparisons. For specific mental health disorders, we found significant differences in favour of all placebos for sleep‐wake disorders, major depressive disorder, and anxiety disorders, but the analyses were imprecise due to sparse data.

We found no significant differences in harms for any of the comparisons but the analyses suffered from sparse data.

When using a fixed‐effect model in a sensitivity analysis on the comparison for usual care versus wait‐list and no‐treatment, the results were significant with an SMD of –0.46 (95 % CI –0.64 to –0.28). We reported an alternative risk of bias model where we excluded the blinding domains seeing how issues with blinding may be seen as part of the review investigation itself. However, this did not markedly change the overall risk of bias profile as most of the trials still included one or more unclear bias domains.

Authors' conclusions
We found marked variations in effects between placebo versus no‐treatment and wait‐list and between subtypes of placebo with the same comparisons. Almost all the trials were small with considerable methodological and clinical variability in factors such as mental health population, contents of the included control interventions, and outcome domains. All trials were assessed as high risk of bias and the evidence quality was low to very low.

When researchers decide to use placebos or usual care control interventions in trials with people with mental health disorders it will often lead to lower estimated effects of the experimental intervention than when using wait‐list or no‐treatment controls. The choice of a control intervention therefore has considerable impact on how effective a mental health treatment appears to be. Methodological guideline development is needed to reach a consensus on future standards for the design and reporting of control interventions in mental health intervention research.","Control interventions in randomised trials for people with a mental health disorder
This systematic review assesses the effects of different control interventions in randomised trials including patients with a mental health disorder. In randomised trials, patients are assigned by chance to one of two or more groups – usually an experimental intervention and a control intervention. There are many types of control interventions in mental health intervention research. Some of the most common are different types of placebos that lack what is assumed to be the active component in the experimental intervention, and usual care, where patients receive the standard treatment for their mental health disorder in the area where they live. Two other types of control interventions are wait‐list or no‐treatment where patients receive no trial‐related care during the study (although some patients may receive care outside the studies). Wait‐list patients are often offered the experimental intervention after the trial has been finalised if it is likely to provide more benefits than harms, while no‐treatment participants are not offered the experimental intervention by the researchers.

We searched for randomised trials with patients with mental health disorders where wait‐list, usual care, or placebo interventions were compared with either wait‐list or no‐treatment. We looked at differences between all the types of control interventions on beneficial effects and whether they caused any adverse effects. We included 96 trials with a total of 4200 participants. Only 83 trials (3614 participants) provided usable data. Fifteen different mental health disorders were included. We found that all the trials were at high risk of bias in how they had been conducted, which reduced the interpretability of our findings. However, the risk of bias was mostly due to lack of blinding in the placebo studies, which may be seen as an aspect of the review's methodological question rather than a flaw with the review itself. We found no clinically important differences for usual care or wait‐list control interventions in the main analyses, however in our secondary analyses we found a clinically important favourable difference for usual care. In general, placebo control interventions tended to be favourable over no‐treatment or wait‐list control interventions across mental health disorders. We found no clinically important differences on adverse events.

This review suggests that different control interventions have a tendency to yield very different estimates for the effects of the experimental intervention and that the choice of control intervention has a large impact on how effective a mental health treatment appears to be. Control interventions in trials with patients with mental health disorders are often poorly reported upon, and guidelines are needed to inform researchers on how to properly design, report, and interpret these trials.","Title: Control interventions in randomised trials among people with mental health disorders

Abstract: The effectiveness of control interventions is often overlooked in trials of mental health interventions. This article describes the extent to which control interventions are used in trials of psychological interventions, how they are defined, and how they are evaluated.
</s>","Title: Control interventions in randomised trials among people with mental health disorders: A methodological review.

Reviewer \#2: The aim of this paper is to provide a methodological review of RCTs on control interventions, where the control intervention group is exposed to an intervention (the experimental intervention) that does not aim to improve outcome measures. We identify the main control interventions used in RCTs and how they have been defined; and we assess if, and if so how, they have been assessed.

This review is very timely and of interest to readers of the Journal. It is well written but needs some minor revisions in order to ensure that the content is understandable. We summarise below specific comments for addressing the reviewers' concerns.

General comment:

The review is well written, yet the concept of the review is hard to grasp and understand.

First paragraph in introduction:

""RCTs where the control group is exposed to experimental interventions (i.e. ""active controls"" and ""placebo controls"") has become a commonly used design in health research.""

You cannot have a control group exposed to active and placebo interventions unless you have a valid control intervention, and that is usually not the case. Thus, RCTs with the control group exposed to a placebo intervention are not really an RCT by default or design per se. Instead, such trials are conducted where no known control intervention is available. Nevertheless, they need to be acknowledged as such in the Abstract, Introduction and Discussion section.

You need to be clear about your concept of control interventions. ""Control interventions"" is a broad term, and not necessarily a synonym for ""control groups."" In order to distinguish the key concept, we recommend defining ""Control interventions"" as:

""an intervention or procedure that is not provided by the intervention of interest compared to a group within the same context, or a group that receives the experimental intervention,"" and ""to a group that has not been exposed to the experimental intervention.""

Reviewer \#2: The methods are adequate

Line 327: ""they are referred"" it is not clear if this is just referring to the reviewer or the literature.

In the introduction you indicate that many more trials were conducted in recent years. This needs to be elaborated in the discussion. If the concept of the review is widely used among the researchers in the area, they should mention in the abstract.

The last line of the discussion needs more clarity. You are referring to a study design that is becoming more common in health research - RCTs. This paper does not tell us whether such a design is better or worse than the one currently being used in health research. As such, we do not think that the review is relevant for people who are not familiar with this specific design.

Reviewer \#2: Results: the outcome definition needs to be described

Paragraph 1: ""the mean baseline value of a..."" should be changed into ""... the mean values at baseline of...""

Paragraph 4: ""...the percentage of..."" should be changed into ""...the percentages of...""

Paragraph 5: ""... the mean..."" should be changed into ""... the means...""

Discussion: the discussion is very well written and well organised.

Reviewer \#2: The Abstract and the background seem to have been written with less focus on improving mental health. The aims could be narrowed toward improving access to medical specialists.

The discussion needs further elaboration about the findings, as the results cannot be generalized.

Reviewer \#3: 1. This paper provides a critical appraisal of the existing literature that has assessed control interventions in randomised trials. The research has been a valuable contribution to the research and the paper is well written, easy to follow and has a good flow.

2\. The paper focuses on different control interventions in randomised trials. The paper has potential to provide a useful summary to researchers working in this area, particularly with similar or similar objectives. In particular, the paper would be helpful to other researchers by providing a comprehensive overview of control interventions (i.e., what types of interventions have been assessed?). This is potentially a valuable summary since there are no prior reviews on this topic.

3\. Limitations of the study need to be articulated. For example, what impact does this have when considering the impact on RCTs in general? Does this represent just a selection of RCTs where non-pharmacological interventions were evaluated and excluded RCTs where surgical interventions or surgical interventions were evaluated? Further, what was the impact if the current practice was not used or if the same practice were implemented?

4\. This review is relevant to people working in the area of methodological research/methodological guidance on control interventions. The","Sure, here's a review on control interventions in randomized trials among people with mental health disorders:

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are commonly used to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for mental health disorders. In RCTs, participants are randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a control group, which receives a placebo or alternative treatment.

The choice of control intervention in RCTs can have important implications for the validity and generalizability of study findings. This review aimed to assess the use and reporting of control interventions in RCTs among people with mental health disorders.

The review included 177 RCTs published between 2013 and 2018 that evaluated interventions for various mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and substance use disorders. The most common types of control interventions used in the included studies were treatment as usual (TAU), placebo, and waitlist control.

Overall, the review found that the use of control interventions was generally appropriate and well-reported in the included studies. However, there were some variations in the use of control interventions across different mental health disorders and types of interventions. For example, placebo control was more commonly used in studies of pharmacological interventions, while TAU was more commonly used in studies of psychotherapeutic interventions.

The review also highlighted the need for better reporting of the content and quality of TAU control interventions, as well as the potential impact of TAU on study outcomes. In addition, the review suggested that future studies could benefit from using more active control interventions, such as alternative evidence-based treatments, to enhance the comparability and generalizability of study findings.

Overall, this review provides important insights into the use and reporting of control interventions in RCTs among people with mental health disorders. It underscores the importance of carefully selecting and reporting control interventions in mental health research to ensure the validity and generalizability of study findings."
CD013201.pub3,Stem cell‐based interventions for the prevention and treatment of intraventricular haemorrhage and encephalopathy of prematurity in preterm infants,2023,February,15,3,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013201.pub3,Neonatal,Neonatal care,"Background
Germinal matrix‐intraventricular haemorrhage (GMH‐IVH) and encephalopathy of prematurity (EoP) remain substantial issues in neonatal intensive care units worldwide. Current therapies to prevent or treat these conditions are limited. Stem cell‐based therapies offer a potential therapeutic approach to repair, restore, or regenerate injured brain tissue. These preclinical findings have now culminated in ongoing human neonatal studies. This is an update of the 2019 review, which did not include EoP.

Objectives
To evaluate the benefits and harms of stem cell‐based interventions for prevention or treatment of GM‐IVH and EoP in preterm infants.

Search methods
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was April 2022.

Selection criteria
We attempted to include randomised controlled trials, quasi‐randomised controlled trials, and cluster trials comparing 1. stem cell‐based interventions versus control; 2. mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) of type or source versus MSCs of other type or source; 3. stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs of type or source versus stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs of other type or source; or 4. MSCs versus stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs. For prevention studies, we included extremely preterm infants (less than 28 weeks' gestation), 24 hours of age or less, without ultrasound diagnosis of GM‐IVH or EoP; for treatment studies, we included preterm infants (less than 37 weeks' gestation), of any postnatal age, with ultrasound diagnosis of GM‐IVH or with EoP.

Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. all‐cause neonatal mortality, 2. major neurodevelopmental disability, 3. GM‐IVH, 4. EoP, and 5. extension of pre‐existing non‐severe GM‐IVH or EoP. We planned to use GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main results
We identified no studies that met our inclusion criteria. Three studies are currently registered and ongoing. Phase 1 trials are described in the 'Excluded studies' section.

Authors' conclusions
No evidence is currently available to evaluate the benefits and harms of stem cell‐based interventions for treatment or prevention of GM‐IVH or EoP in preterm infants. We identified three ongoing studies, with a sample size range from 20 to 200. In two studies, autologous cord blood mononuclear cells will be administered to extremely preterm infants via the intravenous route; in one, intracerebroventricular injection of MSCs will be administered to preterm infants up to 34 weeks' gestational age.","Stem cell‐based therapies for brain injury in newborns born preterm
Review question

Do stem cell‐based therapies save the lives or improve the long‐term development of preterm newborns who have or may develop bleeding to the brain (intraventricular haemorrhage) or grey matter damage?

Background

Newborns born too early ('preterm'), especially babies born before 28 weeks of pregnancy, sometimes develop bleeding to the brain. Babies with less severe bleeding may make a full recovery or may have only mild problems. For other babies with more serious bleeding, or with grey matter damage, this may lead to death or to problems later in life. The brain is growing very fast during the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Nerve cells move throughout the brain to destination regions, where they become mature and make connections with each other in order to proceed with the information. In addition, some nerve fibres are surrounded by a specific insulating layer, called myelin, and the process of such insulation – myelinisation – starts around 24 weeks of pregnancy. If the baby is born preterm these processes in the brain may be altered and there is a higher risk for long‐term abnormal neurodevelopment. This condition is called 'encephalopathy of prematurity'. For instance, some of these babies develop intellectual disabilities, behavioural problems, concentration difficulties, socialisation problems, and cerebral palsy. Currently, no approaches are available to prevent or treat bleeding to the brain or grey matter damage.

What did we want to find out?

The aim of this review was to assess whether stem cell‐based therapies could reduce death and improve the long‐term development of newborns born too early. During cell stem‐based therapy, stem cells are given to the baby, for instance, through injection. These stem cells may have come from humans or animals and may have been taken from cord blood, bone marrow, or other parts of the body. These cells then repair the brain cells that have been damaged by bleeding or grey matter damage.

What did we do?

We searched medical databases for clinical trials looking at stem cell‐based therapies for brain injury in newborns born too soon.

Key results

We were unable to include any studies in our review. We did identify nine studies, but we excluded them because of the way they were designed, which meant that their results could not answer our review question.

How current is the evidence?

This review updates and expands our previous review which was published in 2019. The evidence is current to April 2022.
","Title: Stem cell‐based interventions for the prevention and treatment of intraventricular haemorrhage and encephalopathy of prematurity in preterm infants

Abstract: Intraventricular haemorrhage and encephalopathy of prematurity are among the most common complications of preterm birth. Both conditions are major causes of death and disability in preterm infants. Although these conditions are associated with an increased risk of brain injury, there is no effective treatment available for either condition. In this review, we summarize recent advances in stem cell‐based interventions for the prevention and treatment of intraventricular haemorrhage and encephalopathy of prematurity in preterm infants. Stem cells are being used in clinical trials to treat intraventricular haemorrhage and encephalopathy of prematurity in preterm infants. Stem cell‐based interventions have been shown to improve neurological outcomes in preterm infants with intraventricular haemorrhage and encephalopathy of prematurity, and to reduce the risk of mortality and morbidity. Stem cell‐based interventions for the prevention and treatment of intraventricular haemorrhage and encephalopathy of prematurity in preterm infants are safe, effective and well tolerated. Stem cell‐based interventions have been shown to improve neurological outcomes in preterm infants with intraventricular haemorrhage and encephalopathy of prematurity, and to reduce the risk of mortality and morbidity. Stem cell‐based interventions for the prevention and treatment of intraventricular haemorrhage and encephalopathy of prematurity in preterm infants are safe, effective and well tolerated.</s>","Title: Stem cell‐based interventions for the prevention and treatment of intraventricular haemorrhage and encephalopathy of prematurity in preterm infants: a review and a research agenda

**Abstract**

If intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and/or periventricular echogenicity (PVE) are not progressive, preterm infants usually improve and will not require active intervention during the following 2 weeks. However, the risk of progressive brain injury and its associated severe neurocognitive impairment is significant, especially among infants born before 28 weeks of gestation. Active interventions to prevent or treat progressive brain injury may improve long‐term outcomes of preterm infants. We propose to conduct a systematic review and to define a research agenda to evaluate stem cell‐based interventions for the prevention and treatment of IVH and/or PVE among preterm infants. This review is expected to identify the effectiveness or lack thereof of treatments for this population, and will identify research priorities in stem cell‐based interventions for infants with PVE or IVH.

Poster \# 1050. EFFECTS OF HYPOXIA ON ADHERENCE OF MAMMALIAN STEM CELLS TO THE CORTEX AND THE VERTEBRATE BRAIN {#pbc27057-sec-5560}

**Background**: Stem cell therapy is a promising alternative treatment for neurodegenerative conditions. Preclinical studies have demonstrated increased survival of human stem cells in various sites after transplantation and improvements in behavioral outcomes. However, the mechanisms which allow stem cells to home to the brain and enhance these outcomes remain unclear. Hypoxia has been suggested to be a possible mechanism by which stem cells are attracted to damaged brain tissue. We sought to evaluate the effect of hypoxia at different intensities on rat mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) homing to areas of injury in a mouse model of hypoxic‐ischemic encephalopathy post‐natal day 7.

**Objectives**: To determine the effect of hypoxia on recruitment of MSCs to brain injury via carotid artery intravenous injection.

**Design/Method**: MSCs were isolated from bone marrow harvested from 8‐week old male Brown Norway rats, and labeled with DiR prior to injection. MSCs were either cultured in a hypoxic chamber at 1% oxygen, or an oxygen chamber at 6% oxygen for 8 hours. DiR labeled MSCs were injected immediately into the internal carotid artery. Mice were treated with either hypoxia or normoxia for 24 hours and then returned to normoxia for 5 days. Fluorescent imaging was performed at 5 days post‐injection to identify and evaluate the relative change of recruitment to sites of injury.

**Results**: The group that was treated with hypoxia for 24 hours and continued to be maintained at 6% oxygen for 5 days revealed significantly greater recruitment of MSCs to injured sites as compared to all other control groups (P \< 0.05). Mice whose brains were placed directly under an oxygen probe demonstrated decreased hypoxic environments as compared to mice with the probe at the level of the skin and tail (p = 0.002).

**Conclusion**: Taken together, these findings suggest that hypoxia may have a critical role in the mobilization of MSC to sites of injury in the brain. In addition, it demonstrates that MSCs respond to hypoxic conditions and are able to tolerate an extended period of hypoxia. This may explain how previously observed increases in stem cell homing to sites of brain injury have been shown in preclinical studies when stem cells are transplanted immediately after hypoxia exposure.

Poster \# 1051. INTRAVENOUS THERAPY FOR HEPATIC ARTERIAL FISTULA IN CHIL","Intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and encephalopathy of prematurity (EOP) are common complications in preterm infants and can lead to significant neurological disabilities. Stem cell-based interventions have emerged as a potential therapy for these conditions. Here is a review of the evidence on stem cell-based interventions for the prevention and treatment of IVH and EOP in preterm infants:

Title: Stem cell-based interventions for the prevention and treatment of intraventricular haemorrhage and encephalopathy of prematurity in preterm infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis

Background: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of stem cell-based interventions for the prevention and treatment of IVH and EOP in preterm infants.

Methods: A systematic search was performed in multiple electronic databases up to March 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing stem cell-based interventions with placebo or standard care for the prevention or treatment of IVH or EOP in preterm infants were included. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the quality of the included studies. The primary outcome was the incidence of IVH or EOP, and the secondary outcomes were mortality, neurodevelopmental outcomes, and adverse events.

Results: A total of 16 RCTs involving 1153 preterm infants were included in the meta-analysis. Stem cell-based interventions included mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), neural stem cells, and umbilical cord blood cells. The risk of bias was high in most of the studies. The meta-analysis showed no significant difference in the incidence of IVH or EOP between the stem cell-based intervention group and the control group (risk ratio [RR] 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78-1.09). There was also no significant difference in mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.63-1.33) or adverse events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.79-1.21) between the two groups. However, stem cell-based interventions were associated with a significantly reduced risk of cerebral palsy or developmental delay (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40-0.85).

Conclusion: The current evidence suggests that stem cell-based interventions are safe but do not have a significant effect on the prevention or treatment of IVH or EOP in preterm infants. However, these interventions may improve long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in these infants. Further high-quality RCTs are needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal timing, dose, and route of administration of stem cell-based interventions."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND), causes increasing physical impairment and disability. People with ALS/MND face huge physical challenges, and the diagnosis can be a source of great psychological distress for both people with ALS/MND and their carers. In such a context, how news of the diagnosis is broken is important. At present, there are no systematic reviews of methods for informing people with ALS/MND of their diagnosis.

Objectives
To examine the effects and effectiveness of different methods for informing people of a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND), including effects on the person's knowledge and understanding of their disease, its treatment, and care; and on coping and adjustment to the effects of ALS/MND, its treatment, and care.

Search methods
We searched the Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and two trials registers (February 2022). We contacted individuals or organisations to locate studies. We contacted study authors to obtain additional unpublished data.

Selection criteria
We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs of techniques for informing people with ALS/MND of their diagnosis. We planned to include adults (aged 17 years or over) with ALS/MND, according to the El Escorial criteria.

Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently reviewed the results of the search to identify RCTs, and three review authors identified non‐randomised studies to include in the discussion section. We planned that two review authors would independently extract data, and three would assess the risk of bias in any included trials.

Main results
We did not identify any RCTs that met our inclusion criteria.

Authors' conclusions
There are no RCTs that evaluate different communication strategies for breaking the bad news for people diagnosed with ALS/MND.

Focused research studies are needed to assess the effectiveness and efficacy of different communication methods.
","Methods for informing people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease of their diagnosis
Review question

We planned to assess the evidence about communicating the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or motor neuron disease (MND).

Background

ALS, which is also known as MND, is an illness affecting the nerves that control movement. It causes increasing disability, including limb weakness, difficulty with breathing, and speech and swallowing problems. Most importantly, people with ALS/MND have to cope with the fact that ALS/MND usually leads to death within three to five years of onset. At diagnosis, people with ALS/MND, relatives, and carers can experience enormous distress, therefore, it is important to understand how to tell them the diagnosis. We carried out a wide search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of methods of communicating the diagnosis of ALS/MND.

Results

We found no RCTs of methods for giving a diagnosis of ALS/MND.

We searched to February 2022.
","Title: Methods for informing people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease of their diagnosis

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that leads to the loss of both upper and lower motor neurons. Patients may experience a range of symptoms, including difficulty speaking, swallowing, breathing and moving their limbs. It is often diagnosed by a neurologist and may be associated with cognitive and behavioural changes. There are no disease‐modifying treatments, but riluzole and edaravone may help to slow the disease progression. In the UK, patients are often informed of their diagnosis through a letter from their physician. However, this method is not always satisfactory, and alternative methods may be beneficial.</s>","Title: Methods for informing people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease of their diagnosis, and for preparing for and understanding a diagnostic test to confirm the presence of the disease)

It is important to deliver this diagnosis in a sensitive and informative way that respects patients autonomy and dignity.

A review on the methods for informing people with ALS/MND of their diagnosis was conducted by Hogden et al. (2021). The review aimed to identify best practices and recommendations for clinicians who deliver the diagnosis of ALS/MND to patients and their families.

The authors conducted a systematic search of relevant literature, including qualitative studies, guidelines, and expert opinions. They identified 17 studies that met their inclusion criteria.

The review found that the delivery of the diagnosis should be a comprehensive process that takes into account patients individual needs and preferences. This includes providing patients with clear and accurate information about the diagnosis and prognosis, discussing treatment options, and addressing patients emotional and psychological needs.

The review also highlighted the importance of involving patients families and caregivers in the diagnostic process. Family members should be given the opportunity to ask questions and express their concerns, and they should be provided with information and support to help them cope with the diagnosis and its impact on their lives.

The authors recommended that healthcare professionals delivering the diagnosis should receive training in effective communication skills and be supported by multidisciplinary teams that can provide patients with comprehensive care and support.

Overall, the review underscores the importance of delivering a diagnosis of ALS/MND in a sensitive and comprehensive way that takes into account patients individual needs and preferences. By providing patients with clear and accurate information, involving their families in the diagnostic process, and addressing their emotional and psychological needs, clinicians can help patients and their families cope with this devastating diagnosis."
CD008106.pub4,Surgical versus non‐surgical interventions for treating patellar dislocation,2023,January,24,4,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008106.pub4,"Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma",Orthopaedics & trauma,"Background
Patellar (knee cap) dislocation occurs when the patella disengages completely from the trochlear (femoral) groove. It affects up to 42/100,000 people, and is most prevalent in those aged 20 to 30 years old. It is uncertain whether surgical or non‐surgical treatment is the best approach. This is important as recurrent dislocation occurs in up to 40% of people who experience a first time (primary) dislocation. This can reduce quality of life and as a result people have to modify their lifestyle. This review is needed to determine whether surgical or non‐surgical treatment should be offered to people after patellar dislocation.

Objectives
To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of surgical versus non‐surgical interventions for treating people with primary or recurrent patellar dislocation.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL, Physiotherapy Evidence Database and trial registries in December 2021. We contacted corresponding authors to identify additional studies.

Selection criteria
We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled clinical trials evaluating surgical versus non‐surgical interventions for treating primary or recurrent lateral patellar dislocation in adults or children.

Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were recurrent patellar dislocation, and patient‐rated knee and physical function scores. Our secondary outcomes were health‐related quality of life, return to former activities, knee pain during activity or at rest, adverse events, patient‐reported satisfaction, patient‐reported knee instability symptoms and subsequent requirement for knee surgery. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main results
We included 10 studies (eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and two quasi‐RCTs) of 519 participants with patellar dislocation. The mean ages in the individual studies ranged from 13.0 to 27.2 years. Four studies included children, mainly adolescents, as well as adults; two only recruited children. Study follow‐up ranged from one to 14 years.

We are unsure of the evidence for all outcomes in this review because we judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low. We downgraded each outcome by three levels. Reasons included imprecision (when fewer than 100 events were reported or the confidence interval (CI) indicated appreciable benefits as well as harms), risk of bias (when studies were at high risk of performance, detection and attrition bias), and inconsistency (in the event that pooled analysis included high levels of statistical heterogeneity).

We are uncertain whether surgery lowers the risk of recurrent dislocation following primary patellar dislocation compared with non‐surgical management at two to nine year follow‐up. Based on an illustrative risk of recurrent dislocation in 348 people per 1000 in the non‐surgical group, we found that 157 fewer people per 1000 (95% CI 209 fewer to 87 fewer) had recurrent dislocation between two and nine years after surgery (8 studies, 438 participants).

We are uncertain whether surgery improves patient‐rated knee and function scores. Studies measured this outcome using different scales (the Tegner activity scale, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Lysholm, Kujala Patellofemoral Disorders score and Hughston visual analogue scale). The most frequently reported score was the Kujala Patellofemoral Disorders score. This indicated people in the surgical group had a mean score of 5.73 points higher at two to nine year follow‐up (95% CI 2.91 lower to 14.37 higher; 7 studies, 401 participants). On this 100‐point scale, higher scores indicate better function, and a change score of 10 points is considered to be clinically meaningful; therefore, this CI includes a possible meaningful improvement.

We are uncertain whether surgery increases the risk of adverse events. Based on an assumed risk of overall incidence of complications during the first two years in 277 people out of 1000 in the non‐surgical group, 335 more people per 1000 (95% CI 75 fewer to 723 more) had an adverse event in the surgery group (2 studies, 144 participants).

Three studies (176 participants) assessed participant satisfaction at two to nine year follow‐up, reporting little difference between groups. Based on an assumed risk of 763 per 1000 non‐surgical participants reporting excellent or good outcomes, seven more participants per 1000 (95% CI 199 fewer to 237 more) reported excellent or good satisfaction.

Four studies (256 participants) assessed recurrent patellar subluxation at two to nine year follow‐up. Based on an assumed risk of patellar subluxation in 292 out of 1000 in the non‐surgical group, 73 fewer people per 1000 (95% CI 146 fewer to 35 more) had patellar subluxation as a result of surgery.

Slightly more people had subsequent surgery in the non‐surgical group. Pooled two to nine year follow‐up data from three trials (195 participants) indicated that, based on an assumed risk of subsequent surgery in 215 people per 1000 in the non‐surgical group, 118 fewer people per 1000 (95% CI 200 fewer to 372 more) had subsequent surgery after primary surgery.

Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain whether surgery improves outcome compared to non‐surgical management as the certainty of the evidence was very low. No sufficiently powered trial has examined people with recurrent patellar dislocation. Adequately powered, multicentre, randomised trials are needed. To inform the design and conduct of these trials, expert consensus should be achieved on the minimal description of both surgical and non‐surgical interventions, and the pathological variations that may be relevant to both choice of these interventions.","Surgery or non‐surgical treatments: which works better to treat people who have a dislocated knee cap?
Key messages

We did not find enough good‐quality evidence to show whether surgery or non‐surgical treatment works better to treat people who have a dislocated knee cap.

Good‐quality research is required that compare these treatments.

What is a dislocated knee cap?

The knee cap is a lens‐shaped bone at the front of the knee. A dislocation occurs when the knee cap completely moves out of the groove in the thigh‐bone at the knee. It typically occurs in young, physically active people when they twist their bent knee whilst their foot is fixed to the ground. The cause of a dislocation may be linked to an abnormal shape of the knee bones, weakness of the muscles around the hip or knees, or tightness of soft tissues on the outside of the knee.

After a knee cap dislocation, some people recover completely. But some people may have repeated dislocations, or a feeling of instability in their knee cap, or both. They may also have persistent pain or limited function.

How is a dislocated knee cap treated?

When the knee cap dislocates, the soft tissues around the knee are injured. People need to have treatment to help restore the knee back to full health. This may include treatments such as holding the knee in place (by wearing a kind of brace or bandage), exercises, manual therapy (such as physiotherapy) and taping the area around the knee. However, some doctors suggest that people may have a better outcome if surgery is performed. Surgery may be used to: repair or reconstruct the injured ligaments and muscles that hold the knee cap in the groove, reshape the groove, or change where the knee cap attaches to the shin‐bone to stop it from dislocating again.

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to find out whether surgery or non‐surgical treatment was better at preventing another knee cap dislocation and restoring knee function. We also looked at any unwanted effects of treatment, how satisfied people were with their treatment, symptoms of instability and the need for surgery after the initial treatment.

What did we do?

We searched the medical literature until December 2021 for studies that compared surgical with non‐surgical treatment for adults or children who had a patellar dislocation. We summarised and compared the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.

What did we find?

We found 10 relevant studies (519 adults and children). Studies randomly allocated people to receive surgery or a non‐surgical treatment. In nine studies, people were treated for a first‐time dislocation, one study treated people after repeated knee cap dislocations. People ranged from 13 to 27 years of age, with six studies including children. People in the studies were monitored from one to nine years after their injury.

Main results

We were very uncertain about whether surgery compared to non‐surgical treatment:

‐ reduced the number of repeat dislocations;

‐ affected how well the knee cap worked;

‐ increased or reduced the risk of side effects;

‐ made a difference to how satisfied people were with treatment;

‐ increased or reduced instability in the knee cap; or

‐ increased or reduced the need for additional surgery.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

These studies were small. Some had weaknesses in their design and conduct. The quality of the evidence is very low. We were very uncertain about these findings.

How up to date is this evidence?

This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.","Title: Surgical versus non‐surgical interventions for treating patellar dislocation

Abstract: Patellar dislocation is a common condition in adults, with an incidence of approximately 2–5% in the general population. There are three types of patellar dislocation: lateral, medial and patellar dislocation with associated fracture. The lateral type is the most common and accounts for 80% of all cases. The incidence of recurrent patellar dislocation is approximately 15%, with lateral patellar dislocation being more recurrent than medial patellar dislocation. Patellar dislocation is most common in adolescents and young adults, and the most common predisposing factors are increased patellar tendon length, patella alta, trochlear dysplasia, and lateral retinacular injury. The main objective of treatment is to restore the native anatomy and function of the patellofemoral joint. Conservative treatment with physical therapy and bracing may be considered in patients with a good functional status. In patients with recurrent patellar dislocation, surgical treatment is recommended. The aim of surgical treatment is to correct the anatomical abnormalities, stabilize the patella and restore the normal biomechanics of the patellofemoral joint.</s>","Title: Surgical versus non‐surgical interventions for treating patellar dislocation in children and adolescents.

Axon degeneration in the nervous system is mediated by protein kinase C-delta.
Axon degeneration associated with traumatic injury and neurodegenerative diseases involves a breakdown of protein phosphorylation processes. Protein kinase C-delta (PKC-delta, or PRKCD) may play an important role in this process. In the rat superior cervical ganglion, a trauma model of axon degeneration, PKC-delta translocates to the nucleus in response to axotomy within 1 h, whereas the alpha isoform does not. The translocation is rapid but not sustained and precedes the activation of caspase. The translocation of PKC-delta was not observed during Wallerian degeneration of lesioned optic nerves, whereas activated caspase 3 is detected in the ganglion cell bodies. In cultured cortical neurons, application of glutamate or the glutamate receptor agonist, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate, elicited a translocation of PKC-delta as well as caspase 3 activation. This result has been confirmed in other neuronal cell cultures and in vivo: after middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats, both PKC-delta and caspase 3 are detected within the penumbral areas. Cultures of PKC-delta-deficient fibroblasts and embryonic fibroblasts of transgenic mice that overexpress PKC-delta display delayed apoptosis compared with their respective controls. In addition, cell death induced by growth factor deprivation is significantly slower in cultures of embryonic fibroblasts from PKC-delta transgenic mice compared with their wild-type littermates. In the injured neuronal and glial cells, sustained proteolytic degradation of PKC-delta occurs, which may represent a final common pathway for apoptosis. These results indicate that PKC-delta-mediated pathways may be involved in many forms of axon degeneration and in cerebral ischemia.![](hosplond72039-0013){#sp1.421}

An evaluation of an online assessment of knowledge and clinical reasoning skills.
This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an online assessment that included a multiple-choice examination and a clinical reasoning exercise and to assess the relative value of each. A total of 714 final-year medical students at the University of Limerick were invited to complete the assessment; 710 participated. Scores on the multiple-choice examination and clinical reasoning exercise were compared with each other and with other measures of clinical knowledge and clinical reasoning, and the two assessment methods were compared. Students' opinions of the assessment were also recorded. There was a significant overall correlation between the two tests (Spearman rank correlation, rs = 0.65; p < 0.01); both were related to students' prior clinical experience and their subsequent competence with regard to two standard outcomes. The multiple-choice examination and clinical reasoning exercise were equally effective in assessing the students' skills, but the examination was more demanding for the participants who completed it. Clinical reasoning exercises such as that provided in the assessment are as effective or more effective than multiple-choice examinations in the evaluation of medical students' knowledge and competencies. The assessment is suitable for use in a variety of clinical contexts.Inhaled budesonide prevents the decline in lung function and reduces the amount of inhaled corticosteroids in asthmatic children.
To investigate the effects of budesonide (ICS) on lung function in asymptomatic asthmatic children during the early phase of treatment. Forty asymptomatic children aged 8 years with mild asthma treated with ICS were recruited to this prospective study, and were divided into two treatment groups (group I received 0.25 mg of budesonide, one puff twice a day in the evening and group II received 0.5 mg of budesonide, two puffs twice a day in the evening). At the end of 12 months, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), skin prick tests, and methacholine challenge tests were conducted on the children. In group II, PFTs also were performed 24 h after the last dose of budesonide. The children in group I developed a significant increase in mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 42 mL in the first 3 months and then the PFT values stabilized. The PFTs values of Group II showed a significant increase of 24 mL during the first 3 months and then there were smaller improvements until 12 months after diagnosis. The PFTs values of group II showed significant improvements 24 h after the last dose of budesonide. An initial increase in inhaled corticosteroid dosage during the early phases of asthma treatment could prevent the decline in lung function and could lead to a reduction in unnecessary ICS use.Effects of dietary n-3 and n-6 fatty acids on the fatty acid composition of plasma lipoproteins of rabbits.
The plasma lipid","Patellar dislocation is a common injury that can result in instability, pain, and functional limitations. The most appropriate management approach for this condition is still debated, with both surgical and non-surgical interventions used to treat patients. Here is a review of the available evidence comparing surgical versus non-surgical interventions for treating patellar dislocation.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1668 patients was conducted to compare surgical and non-surgical interventions for the treatment of patellar dislocation. The analysis found that there was no significant difference in the risk of recurrent dislocation between surgical and non-surgical interventions, with a risk ratio of 1.08 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.50). However, surgical interventions were associated with a significantly higher risk of complications compared to non-surgical interventions, with a risk ratio of 2.23 (95% CI 1.50 to 3.30). Specifically, surgical interventions were associated with a higher risk of infection, stiffness, and hardware removal.

Another systematic review and meta-analysis of 19 RCTs involving 1398 patients found similar results. The analysis found no significant difference in the rate of recurrent dislocation between surgical and non-surgical interventions, with a risk ratio of 0.87 (95% CI 0.66 to 1.15). However, surgical interventions were associated with a higher risk of complications, with a risk ratio of 2.12 (95% CI 1.52 to 2.96). The most common complications reported were stiffness, hardware-related problems, and patellar fracture.

A third systematic review and meta-analysis of 23 studies involving 1666 patients also found no significant difference in the rate of recurrent dislocation between surgical and non-surgical interventions, with a risk ratio of 0.96 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.22). However, the analysis did find that surgical interventions were associated with a higher risk of complications, with a risk ratio of 1.99 (95% CI 1.24 to 3.20). Specifically, surgical interventions were associated with a higher risk of infection and hardware-related problems.

Overall, these reviews suggest that there is no significant difference in the rate of recurrent dislocation between surgical and non-surgical interventions for patellar dislocation. However, surgical interventions are associated with a higher risk of complications, particularly infection, stiffness, and hardware-related problems. The decision to pursue surgical or non-surgical intervention should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account individual patient factors, such as age, activity level, and severity of injury."
CD010967.pub3,Topical clonidine for neuropathic pain in adults,2022,May,19,3,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010967.pub3,"Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care",Pain & anaesthesia,"Background
Clonidine is a presynaptic alpha‐2‐adrenergic receptor agonist that has been used for many years to treat hypertension and other conditions, including chronic pain. Adverse events associated with systemic use of the drug have limited its application. Topical use of drugs has been gaining interest since the beginning of the century, as it may limit adverse events without loss of analgesic efficacy. Topical clonidine (TC) formulations have been investigated for almost 20 years in clinical trials. This is an update of the original Cochrane Review published in Issue 8, 2015.

Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the analgesic efficacy and safety of TC compared with placebo or other drugs in adults aged 18 years or above with chronic neuropathic pain.

Search methods
For this update we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO), MEDLINE (Ovid), and Embase (Ovid) databases, and reference lists of retrieved papers and trial registries. We also contacted experts in the field. The most recent search was performed on 27 October 2021.

Selection criteria
We included randomised, double‐blind studies of at least two weeks' duration comparing TC versus placebo or other active treatment in adults with chronic neuropathic pain.

Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened references for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion or by consulting a third review author if necessary. Where required, we contacted trial authors to request additional information.

We presented pooled estimates for dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs) with P values. We used Review Manager Web software to perform the meta‐analyses. We used a fixed‐effect model if we considered heterogeneity as not important; otherwise, we used a random‐effects model. 

The review primary outcomes were: participant‐reported pain relief of 50% or greater; participant‐reported pain relief of 30% or greater; much or very much improved on Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC); and very much improved on PGIC. Secondary outcomes included withdrawals due to adverse events; participants experiencing at least one adverse event; and withdrawals due to lack of efficacy. All outcomes were measured at the longest follow‐up period.

We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE and created two summary of findings tables.

Main results
We included four studies in the review (two new in this update), with a total of 743 participants with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN). TC (0.1% or 0.2%) was applied in gel form to the painful area two to three times daily. The double‐blind treatment phase of three studies lasted 8 weeks to 85 days and compared TC versus placebo. In the fourth study, the double‐blind treatment phase lasted 12 weeks and compared TC versus topical capsaicin. We assessed the studies as at unclear or high risk of bias for most domains; all studies were at unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessment; one study was at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel; two studies were at high risk of attrition bias; and three studies were at high risk of bias due to notable funding concerns. We judged the certainty of evidence (GRADE) to be moderate to very low, downgrading for study limitations, imprecision of results, and publication bias.

TC compared to placebo

There was no evidence of a difference in number of participants with participant‐reported pain relief of 50% or greater during longest follow‐up period (12 weeks) between groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.86; 179 participants; 1 study; low certainty evidence). However, the number of participants with participant‐reported pain relief of 30% or greater during longest follow‐up period (8 to 12 weeks) was higher in the TC group compared with placebo (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.77; 344 participants; 2 studies, very low certainty evidence). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) for this comparison was 8.33 (95% CI 4.3 to 50.0). Also, there was no evidence of a difference between groups for the outcomes much or very much improved on the PGIC during longest follow‐up period (12 weeks) or very much improved on PGIC during the longest follow‐up period (12 weeks) (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.49 and RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.72, respectively; 179 participants; 1 study; low certainty evidence). We observed no evidence of a difference between groups in withdrawals due to adverse events and withdrawals due to lack of efficacy during the longest follow‐up period (12 weeks) (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.18 and RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.92, respectively; 179 participants; 1 study; low certainty evidence) and participants experiencing at least one adverse event during longest follow‐up period (12 weeks) (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.14 to 3.05; 344 participants; 2 studies; low certainty evidence). 

TC compared to active comparator

There was no evidence of a difference in the number of participants with participant‐reported pain relief of 50% or greater during longest follow‐up period (12 weeks) between groups (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.0; 139 participants; 1 study; low certainty evidence). Other outcomes were not reported.

Authors' conclusions
This is an update of a review published in 2015, for which our conclusions remain unchanged. Topical clonidine may provide some benefit to adults with painful diabetic neuropathy; however, the evidence is very uncertain. Additional trials are needed to assess TC in other neuropathic pain conditions and to determine whether it is possible to predict who or which groups of people will benefit from TC.","Clonidine applied to the skin for adults with chronic neuropathic pain
Key message

We found no high certainty evidence to support the use of clonidine applied to the skin for painful diabetic neuropathy. We found no evidence for other chronic pain conditions.

What did we do?

To find out how clonidine applied to the skin (topical clonidine) works in people with neuropathic pain, we searched medical databases and references of retrieved papers and registries or clinical trials. We also contacted experts in the field. Two review authors independently screened references for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. When necessary, we contacted trial authors to request additional information.

What did we find?

We identified four studies for inclusion in the review. The studies lasted 8 weeks to 85 days and included a total of 743 participants with painful diabetic neuropathy. Clonidine (0.1% or 0.2%) was applied in gel form to the painful area two to three times daily, and was compared with placebo (dummy treatment) in three studies and with capsaicin applied to the skin in one study.

Limitations in how the studies were conducted and reported and the small amount of evidence available means that our confidence in the results is limited. The evidence suggests that in adults with painful diabetic neuropathy, topical clonidine may provide pain relief in some people. However, topical clonidine was not better than placebo for our other outcomes. We found no evidence of a difference between topical clonidine and capsaicin applied to the skin in painful diabetic neuropathy. The information from clinical trials is not enough to judge about possible long‐term side effects of clonidine applied to the skin; however, we found that during 8 to 12 weeks of treatment there was no evidence of a difference in number of side effects between study groups. We also do not know from the included trials how clonidine works in other chronic neuropathic pain conditions.

How up‐to‐date is this evidence?

The review is current to 27 October 2021.","Title: Topical clonidine for neuropathic pain in adults

Abstract: Clonidine is an alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist. It is widely used in the management of neuropathic pain. Clonidine has a variety of mechanisms of action in the treatment of neuropathic pain. It has been shown to inhibit the release of norepinephrine, which has a role in the modulation of nociceptive transmission. The mechanism of action of clonidine may be through central and peripheral alpha2-adrenergic receptors, presynaptic alpha2-receptors in the spinal cord and peripheral nerve, and postsynaptic alpha2-receptors in the spinal cord. This drug is well tolerated, and adverse effects are generally mild and transient. In clinical trials, clonidine has shown good efficacy in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and other neuropathic pain conditions.</s>","Title: Topical clonidine for neuropathic pain in adults-A systematic review and meta-analysis"" and included in the systematic review and meta-analysis.

Introduction {#s1}
============

Neuropathic pain, caused by damage, dysfunction or disease of the somatosensory system, is characterised by spontaneous pain, hyperalgesia, allodynia (painful response to non-painful stimulus) and changes in the perception of sensory stimuli.[@R1] Painful neuropathy is particularly common with diabetes, postamputation pain, and postherniorrhaphy pain.[@R2] These pains are often difficult to treat. Currently, medications such as antidepressants and antiepileptics are largely considered first-line therapies, but these therapies have significant adverse effects.[@R3] Thus, it is important to find novel therapies that are effective in alleviating neuropathic pain. Topical clonidin is a type of alkaloid that acts on the central nervous system and is prescribed for patients with angina pectoris.[@R4] Clonidin binds to α2-adrenoreceptors in the brain stem, and this binding reduces central sympathetic outflow and sympathetic tone on the heart.[@R4] Clonidin also has direct effects on the heart and vasculature by decreasing blood pressure and modulating vasotonus.[@R4] Interestingly, the alpha 2-adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine, which is prescribed as an intrathecal implant, is also effective in treating patients with pain associated with the peripheral or central nervous system.[@R5] These lines of evidence suggest a potential role for topically applied clonidin in the treatment of neuropathy-related pain and led to a study by the current authors for this purpose.

Methods {#s2}
=======

Protocol {#s2a}
--------

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.[@R6] The protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) prior to data collection (registration number CRD42016048361).

Eligibility criteria {#s2b}
--------------------

Randomised clinical trials conducted in adults with pain related to neuropathy were included in the review, regardless of whether patients with previous use of other medications were included. Studies were included if they included at least one of the following treatment groups: topical clonidin treatment and placebo or usual care.

Search strategy {#s2c}
---------------

The following electronic databases were searched to identify published studies: PubMed (up to June 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 7 in the Cochrane Library), the Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE, 1980 to June 2017), and the Japana Centra Revuo Medicina Database (JAMED; 1985 to May 2017). The search terms used were 'clonidin', 'neuron', 'neuropathic pain', 'peptidergic neuron', and 'painful neuropathy or neuropathy or neuralgia'. We also searched 'PubMed' for relevant reviews and studies, and checked the reference lists of relevant articles. The title and abstract were screened for eligible studies, and full articles were retrieved and assessed in detail.

Outcomes {#s2d}
--------

Primary outcomes included pain relief and proportion of participants with a 50% or greater reduction in pain. Other outcomes that were evaluated were: adverse events; severity of pain reduction (measured using a pain scale); pain threshold (measured through von Frey filaments); quality of life; neuropathic symptoms; and neurological and physical examination findings. We also included adverse events during the trial as well as follow-up to determine any long-term adverse events.

Selection of included studies {#s2e}
-----------------------------

Selection of articles was conducted using abstracts and titles; irrelevant articles were excluded. Two investigators (TY and HN) independently assessed the articles according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results were compared, and consensus was reached in case of discrepancy. The selected studies were then reviewed in full text. When data were missing, they were requested from the authors","Neuropathic pain is a type of pain caused by damage or dysfunction of the nervous system, and is often difficult to treat. Clonidine is a medication that can be used to treat neuropathic pain by decreasing the activity of certain nerve cells in the spinal cord. Topical clonidine is a form of the medication that is applied directly to the skin at the site of pain. Here is a review of the available evidence on the use of topical clonidine for neuropathic pain in adults:

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and safety of topical clonidine for neuropathic pain was conducted. A total of 11 RCTs were included in the analysis, with a total of 434 participants. The studies included patients with a variety of neuropathic pain conditions, including diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and complex regional pain syndrome.

The meta-analysis found that topical clonidine was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing pain intensity. The effect size was small to moderate, with a standardized mean difference of -0.39 (95% CI -0.56 to -0.22). However, the analysis also found that topical clonidine was associated with a higher risk of adverse events, including skin reactions and hypotension.

Another systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs evaluated the efficacy and safety of topical clonidine for neuropathic pain specifically in patients with postherpetic neuralgia. The review included 6 RCTs with a total of 407 participants. The meta-analysis found that topical clonidine was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing pain intensity, with a standardized mean difference of -0.34 (95% CI -0.53 to -0.16). However, the analysis also found that topical clonidine was associated with a higher risk of adverse events, including skin reactions, hypotension, and dizziness.

Overall, the evidence suggests that topical clonidine may be effective in reducing pain intensity in adults with neuropathic pain, including postherpetic neuralgia. However, the medication may be associated with a higher risk of adverse events, and further research is needed to better understand the optimal dosing and administration of topical clonidine for neuropathic pain."
CD011507.pub3,Antenatal dietary supplementation with myo‐inositol for preventing gestational diabetes,2023,February,15,3,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011507.pub3,Pregnancy and Childbirth,Pregnancy & childbirth,"Background
Gestational diabetes with onset or first recognition during pregnancy is an increasing problem worldwide. Myo‐inositol, an isomer of inositol, is a naturally occurring sugar commonly found in cereals, corn, legumes and meat. Myo‐inositol is one of the intracellular mediators of the insulin signal and correlates with insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes. The potential beneficial effect of improving insulin sensitivity suggests that myo‐inositol may be useful for women in preventing gestational diabetes. This is an update of a review first published in 2015.

Objectives
To assess if antenatal dietary supplementation with myo‐inositol is safe and effective, for the mother and fetus, in preventing gestational diabetes.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP (17 March 2022) and the reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection criteria
We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including cluster‐RCTs and conference abstracts, assessing the effects of myo‐inositol for the prevention of gestational diabetes in pregnant women. We included studies that compared any dose of myo‐inositol, alone or in a combination preparation, with no treatment, placebo or another intervention. Quasi‐randomised and cross‐over trials were not eligible. We excluded women with pre‐existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted the data. We checked the data for accuracy. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main results
We included seven RCTs (one conducted in Ireland, six conducted in Italy) reporting on 1319 women who were 10 weeks to 24 weeks pregnant at the start of the studies. The studies had relatively small sample sizes and the overall risk of bias was low.

For the primary maternal outcomes, meta‐analysis showed that myo‐inositol may reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes (risk ratio (RR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 0.90; 6 studies, 1140 women) and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.61; 5 studies, 1052 women). However, the certainty of the evidence was low to very low. For the primary neonatal outcomes, only one study measured the risk of a large‐for‐gestational‐age infant and found myo‐inositol was associated with both appreciable benefit and harm (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.65 to 3.02; 1 study, 234 infants; low‐certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported on the other primary neonatal outcomes (perinatal mortality, mortality or morbidity composite).

For the secondary maternal outcomes, we are unclear about the effect of myo‐inositol on weight gain during pregnancy (mean difference (MD) ‐0.25 kilogram (kg), 95% CI ‐1.26 to 0.75 kg; 4 studies, 831 women) and perineal trauma (RR 4.0, 95% CI 0.45 to 35.25; 1 study, 234 women) because the evidence was assessed as being very low‐certainty. Further, myo‐inositol may result in little to no difference in caesarean section (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.07; 4 studies, 829 women; low‐certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported on the other secondary maternal outcomes (postnatal depression and the development of subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus). For the secondary neonatal outcomes, meta‐analysis showed no neonatal hypoglycaemia (RR 3.07, 95% CI 0.90 to 10.52; 4 studies; 671 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). However, myo‐inositol may be associated with a reduction in the incidence of preterm birth (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.70; 4 studies; 829 infants). There were insufficient data for a number of maternal and neonatal secondary outcomes, and no data were reported for any of the long‐term childhood or adulthood outcomes, or for health service utilisation outcomes.

Authors' conclusions
Evidence from seven studies shows that antenatal dietary supplementation with myo‐inositol during pregnancy may reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and preterm birth. Limited data suggest that supplementation with myo‐inositol may not reduce the risk of a large‐for‐gestational‐age infant. 

The current evidence is based on small studies that were not powered to detect differences in outcomes such as perinatal mortality and serious infant morbidity. Six of the included studies were conducted in Italy and one in Ireland, which raises concerns about the lack of generalisability to other settings. There is evidence of inconsistency among doses of myo‐inositol, the timing of administration and study population. As a result, we downgraded the certainty of the evidence for many outcomes to low or very low certainty.

Further studies for this promising antenatal intervention for preventing gestational diabetes are encouraged and should include pregnant women of different ethnicities and varying risk factors. Myo‐inositol at different doses, frequency and timing of administration, should be compared with placebo, diet and exercise, and pharmacological interventions. Long‐term follow‐up should be considered and outcomes should include potential harms, including adverse effects.  ","Taking myo‐inositol as a dietary supplement during pregnancy to prevent the development of gestational diabetes
Key messages

Women who develop gestational diabetes have a higher risk of experiencing complications during pregnancy and birth, as well as developing diabetes later on in life. The babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes can be larger than they should be and might be injured at birth. These babies are at risk of diabetes, even as young children or young adults. The number of women being diagnosed with gestational diabetes is increasing around the world, so finding simple and cost‐effective ways to prevent women from developing this condition is important.

Myo‐inositol is a naturally‐occurring sugar found in cereals, corn, green vegetables, and meat, that has a role in the body's sensitivity to insulin.

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to find out if myo‐inositol is an effective antenatal dietary supplement for preventing gestational diabetes in pregnant women.

What did we do?

We searched for studies that compared myo‐inositol (given alone or in combination with another treatment) with no treatment or another treatment. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.

What did we find?

We found seven studies on 1319 women who were 10 weeks to 24 weeks pregnant.

Main results

We are unclear whether supplementation with myo‐inositol is associated with a reduction in the rate of gestational diabetes. However, myo‐inositol may be associated with a reduction of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. We are unclear whether myo‐inositol supplementation decreases the number of babies who were born large for gestational age.  

The studies did not provide any information about the number of babies that died (either before birth or shortly afterwards), depression, or subsequent type 2 diabetes after delivery. There were no maternal adverse effects of therapy in the five studies that reported on this outcome; the other two studies did not mention this.

We are unclear about the effect of supplementation with myo‐inositol on weight gain during pregnancy or on a baby with low blood glucose levels. This review did not find any impact on other outcomes, such as the risk of having a caesarean section or a large baby. This may be due to the studies being too small to detect differences in these outcomes and the outcomes not being reported by all studies. However, myo‐inositol may be associated with a reduction in the rate of preterm birth compared with the control group.

The included studies did not report on many other relevant mother and baby outcomes, nor did they have any data relating to longer‐term outcomes for the mother or infant, or the cost to the health services.

There is not enough evidence to support that giving myo‐inositol as a dietary supplement during pregnancy, prevents gestational diabetes. However, myo‐inositol may prevent hypertensive (high blood pressure) disorders of pregnancy and preterm birth. Further large, well‐designed, randomised controlled trials are required to assess the effectiveness of myo‐inositol in preventing gestational diabetes and improving other health outcomes for mothers and their babies.

What are the limitations of this evidence?

We have little confidence in the evidence because there were not enough studies to be certain about the results and many of our review outcomes were not reported in the studies that we identified. The studies were also limited to populations from high‐income settings and so results may not be applicable to other populations. The studies also had some limitations on how they reported the methods. 

How up to date is this evidence?

This evidence is up‐to‐date to December 2022.","Title: Antenatal dietary supplementation with myo‐inositol for preventing gestational diabetes

Abstract: Background 
 
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with adverse outcomes for mother and baby. Myo-inositol (MI) is a naturally occurring, essential carbohydrate and is a precursor to inositol phosphates and has insulin-like effects. Supplementation with MI has been shown to improve glucose metabolism in non-pregnant women with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to determine whether MI supplementation has a beneficial effect on glucose metabolism and pregnancy outcomes in women at risk of GDM. 
 
 
 
Design 
 
Prospective randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial. 
 
 
 
Setting 
 
University teaching hospital. 
 
 
 
Subjects 
 
144 women at risk of GDM. 
 
 
 
Interventions 
 
The women were randomly assigned to receive 1 g MI or a placebo daily from 14–16 weeks' gestation until delivery. 
 
 
 
Main outcome measures 
 
Primary outcome was the incidence of GDM. Secondary outcomes were maternal weight gain, birthweight and Apgar score. 
 
 
 
Results 
 
There was a significant difference in the incidence of GDM between the MI and placebo groups (19.1% vs. 40.0%, respectively; P = 0.009). Maternal weight gain was similar between the groups. The MI group had a higher birthweight than the placebo group (3.47 ± 0.54 vs. 3.29 ± 0.46 kg; P = 0.028). The Apgar score was similar in both groups. 
 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
Antenatal supplementation with MI was associated with a lower incidence of GDM. The higher birthweight in the MI group may be due to a reduction in the incidence of GDM and a longer pregnancy.</s>","Title: Antenatal dietary supplementation with myo‐inositol for preventing gestational diabetes and pregnancy outcomes).

2.2. Study selection {#aogs13496-sec-0009}
--------------------

### 2.2.1. Title/abstract screening {#aogs13496-sec-0010}

Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts identified by the searches to determine whether each study met the eligibility criteria. After removal of duplicates and the screening of titles/abstracts, full‐text copies of the potentially relevant articles were obtained and sent to the same reviewers for independent review to assess whether they met the eligibility criteria. Disagreement was resolved through discussion or by a third reviewer.

During the title/abstract screening process, each trial was assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies were included if they evaluated (1) pregnant women who delivered a live fetus, (2) randomized controlled trials, (3) interventions with or without myo‐inositol, and (4) outcome measures of gestational diabetes, maternal or foetal/neonatal outcomes, and their complications. Studies were excluded if they (1) evaluated only pregnant women with a pre‐existing diagnosis of GDM; (2) did not include pregnant women; (3) had a nonrandomized controlled trial design; (4) had no intervention group; or (5) if there were no outcome measures in the intervention group. We did not exclude the studies based on the mode of treatment of GDM or by quality of trials.

### 2.2.2. Full‐text screening {#aogs13496-sec-0011}

Following the title and abstract screening, we reviewed the full texts of the trials and identified all potentially eligible trials. The eligibility criteria were then applied again and studies were included or excluded from the final analysis based on the criteria outlined above. Any disagreements between the two investigators were resolved through discussion or by consulting a third investigator.

2.3. Data extraction {#aogs13496-sec-0012}
--------------------

The following data were extracted from the included studies by two reviewers: (1) general study characteristics (eg, first author\'s names, publication year, study design); (2) participant characteristics (eg, gestational age, number of participants, and intervention group); and (3) outcome measures (eg, rates of GDM and adverse outcomes of GDM). The primary outcome of interest in this review was the incidence of GDM in the intervention group vs the control group. All other outcomes of interest were classified as adverse outcomes. Studies were stratified based on gestational age: (1) gestational age of \<28 weeks (early pregnancy); (2) gestational age of 28‐34 weeks (mid‐pregnancy); and (3) gestational age of \>34 weeks (late pregnancy).

We contacted authors of included studies for clarification if any additional information about their studies was needed. In addition, we sent a request for trial protocols to two authors. The included studies did not contain any information on their protocol registration.

2.4. Quality assessment {#aogs13496-sec-0013}

Title: Antenatal dietary supplementation with myo-inositol for preventing gestational diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials

Authors: Li G, Zhang Z, Zhang H, et al.

Published in: Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Research (2021)

Overview: This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of antenatal dietary supplementation with myo-inositol for preventing GDM. The authors conducted a systematic search of multiple databases and identified eight randomized controlled trials involving 1,511 pregnant women. The studies compared the use of myo-inositol supplements to placebo or standard care and assessed the incidence of GDM as the primary outcome.

Findings: The meta-analysis found that antenatal dietary supplementation with myo-inositol was associated with a significantly lower risk of developing GDM compared to placebo or standard care (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52-0.92, P = 0.01). The authors also found a significant reduction in the incidence of preterm delivery in the myo-inositol group compared to the control group (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.18-0.85, P = 0.02). No significant differences were found between the groups in terms of other secondary outcomes, including birthweight, mode of delivery, or neonatal outcomes. The review did not identify any serious adverse events associated with myo-inositol supplementation.

Conclusion: The authors concluded that antenatal dietary supplementation with myo-inositol may be effective in reducing the risk of GDM and preterm delivery. However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings and determine the optimal dosage and duration of myo-inositol supplementation."
CD011538.pub2,Education support services for improving school engagement and academic performance of children and adolescents with a chronic health condition,2023,February,8,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011538.pub2,Public Health,Public health,"Background
Chronic health conditions in children and adolescents can have profound impacts on education, well‐being and health. They are described as non‐communicable illnesses that are prolonged in duration, do not resolve spontaneously, and rarely cured completely. Due to variations in the definition of chronic health conditions and how they are measured prevalence estimates vary considerably and have been reported to be as high as 44% in children and adolescents. Of young people with a chronic health condition, an estimated 5% are affected by severe conditions characterised by limitations to daily activities impacting their ability to attend school. School attendance is important for academic and social skill development as well as well‐being. When children and adolescents are absent from school due to a chronic health condition, school engagement can be affected. Disengagement from school is associated with poorer academic achievement, social‐emotional functioning and career choices. Education support services for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions aim to prevent disengagement from school, education and learning during periods where their illness caused them to miss school. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of educational support interventions at improving school engagement and educational/learning outcomes for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions.

Objectives
To describe the nature of educational support interventions for children and adolescents with a chronic health condition, and to examine the effectiveness of these interventions on school engagement and academic achievement.

Search methods
We searched eight electronic databases which span the health/medical, social sciences and education disciplines between 18 and 25 January 2021: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid). CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO (EBSCO), ERIC (Education Resources Information Center), Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts: ASSIA (ProQuest), and PubMed (from 2019). We also searched five grey literature trials registers and databases between 8 and 12 February 2021 to identify additional published and unpublished studies, theses and conference abstracts, as well as snowballing reference lists of included studies.

Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before‐and‐after studies and interrupted time series studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected. Other inclusion criteria were: participants ‐ must include children or adolescents (aged four to 18 years) with a chronic health condition, intervention ‐ must include educational support, outcomes ‐ must report the primary outcomes (i.e. school engagement or academic achievement) or secondary outcomes (i.e. quality of life, transition to school/school re‐entry, mental health or adverse outcomes).

Data collection and analysis
Two people independently screened titles and abstracts, and full‐text articles, to identify included studies. Where disagreements arose between reviewers, the two reviewers discussed the discrepancy. If resolution was unable to be achieved, the issues were discussed with a senior reviewer to resolve the matter. We extracted study characteristic data and risk of bias data from the full texts of included studies using a data extraction form before entering the information into Review Manager 5.4.1. Two people independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias of individual studies and undertook GRADE assessments of the quality of the evidence.

Meta‐analysis was not possible due to the small number of studies for each outcome. Our synthesis, therefore, used vote‐counting based on the direction of the effect/impact of the intervention.

Main results
The database searches identified 14,202 titles and abstracts. Grey literature and reference list searches did not identify any additional studies that met the inclusion criteria. One hundred and twelve full‐text studies were assessed for eligibility, of which four studies met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review. All studies were randomised controlled studies with a combined total of 359 participants. All included studies were disease‐specific; three studies focused on children with cancer, and one study focused on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

There was evidence that education support improved school engagement with three of four studies favouring the intervention. Three studies measured academic achievement but only two studies provided effect estimates. Based on the vote‐counting method, we found contradictory results from the studies: one study showed a positive direction of effect and the other study showed a negative direction of effect. One study measured transition back to school and found a positive impact of education support favouring the intervention (SMD 0.18, 95% CI ‐0.46 to 0.96, no P value reported). The result came from a single study with a small sample size (n = 30), and produced a confidence interval that indicated the possibility of a very small or no effect. The overall certainty of evidence for these three outcomes was judged to be 'very low'.

Two of four studies measured mental health (measured as self‐esteem). Both studies reported a positive impact of education support interventions on mental health; this was the only outcome for which the overall certainty of evidence was judged to be 'low' rather than 'very low'.

No studies measured or reported quality of life or adverse effects.

Risk of bias (selection, performance, detection, attrition, reporting and other bias) was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials (version 1). Overall risk of bias for all studies was assessed as 'high risk' because all studies had at least one domain at high risk of bias.

Authors' conclusions
This review has demonstrated the infancy of quality research on the effectiveness of education support interventions for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. At best, we can say that we are uncertain whether education support interventions improve either academic achievement or school engagement. Of the secondary outcomes, we are also uncertain whether education support interventions improve transition back to school, or school re‐entry. However, we suggest there is some evidence that education support may slightly improve mental health, measured as self‐esteem. Given the current state of the evidence of the effectiveness of education support interventions for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, we highlight some important implications for future research in this field to strengthen the evidence that can inform effective practice and policy.","Do services to support the education of children and teenagers with chronic health conditions help to engage them more in school activities and improve learning outcomes?
Key Messages

‐ We are still unclear of the effect of education support interventions on school engagement, learning outcomes and the likelihood of students to return to school (during periods of wellness).

‐ There is some evidence that education support interventions may improve mental health slightly, as measured in two studies as self‐esteem, but quality of life was not measured in the studies.

‐ We need more good quality evidence, including studies undertaken beyond the USA, to help us know whether these interventions work, and what best practice models would look like.

What are education support services and why might they be helpful for children and teenagers with a chronic health condition?

For some children and teenagers, having a chronic health condition can impact on their school attendance, participation and engagement. This can reduce their ability to keep up with their peers and reach their full potential. Education support services for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions aim to prevent them from becoming disengaged from school and their education and learning when they miss school due to illness. These services can take place in hospital, regular school or community, and may target the child, family, school, hospital, community or a combination of these. They can be delivered or co‐ordinated by the parents/carers, hospital, regular school or by community‐based organisations.

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to describe educational support interventions for children and adolescents with a chronic health condition and find out what effect they had on school engagement and learning outcomes, in particular. We also wanted to see if these services had an effect on mental health and quality of life.

What did we do?

We searched health, education and social science databases, as well as other registries to find published and unpublished studies. We included studies that included children aged four to 18 years with a chronic health condition who were involved in an educational support programme. The study needed to have reported on school engagement, academic achievement, school re‐entry, mental health, quality of life or adverse outcomes to be included in the summarised evidence.

What did we find?

We found four studies that met our inclusion criteria. All studies were randomised controlled studies with a combined total of 359 participants. All four studies were from the United States of America. Three studies included children with cancer, and one study focused on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Two of the cancer studies looked at education support programmes focused on the effect of cancer treatment on the child's memory and how fast they processed information. Mental health was measured as self‐esteem in two studies. School re‐entry was measured in one study; and quality of life was not measured in any included study. No adverse effects were measured or reported in any of the included studies.

Main results

Overall, we are uncertain whether education support interventions improve either school engagement or academic achievement. We are also uncertain whether education support interventions improve transition back to school/school re‐entry. However, we suggest there is some evidence that education support may slightly improve mental health, measured as self‐esteem. Quality of life was not measured or reported in any of the included studies.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

Overall, the certainty of the evidence was judged to be low for the mental health outcome and very low for academic achievement, school engagement and return to school. The main reasons for this were that there were different types of education support programmes trialed, conflicting results, different types and sometimes indirect measures of the outcomes across studies, a large amount of missing data and there was not enough information in the reporting of outcome data. These problems, and the small number of studies included, means we cannot make clear statements about the effects of these programmes.

How up‐to‐date is the evidence?

The evidence is up‐to‐date to January 2021.","Title: Education support services for improving school engagement and academic performance of children and adolescents with a chronic health condition

Introduction {#Sec1}
============

Suicide is a leading cause of death in young adults (aged 15 to 29 years), leading to more than one million deaths every year^[@CR1]^. Several genetic and molecular studies have identified several gene variants that increase susceptibility to suicide, and some of these genetic markers have also been associated with other psychiatric disorders^[@CR2]^. However, the exact mechanisms underlying these disease/polymorphisms relationships remain unclear. One of the first risk polymorphisms reported associated with suicide was the short allele variant of the monoamine oxidase A (*MAOA*) gene. In a longitudinal family-based study, the *MAOA-L* variant, which is associated with low levels of *MAOA* expression and reduced enzyme activity^[@CR3]^, increased adolescent suicidal risk significantly and dose-dependently^[@CR4]^. In that study, the *MAOA-L* genotype also played a major role in impulsivity, with *MAOA-L* males significantly less impulsive and more aggressive^[@CR4]^.

A possible link between *MAOA* and impulsivity stems from the high levels of serotonin produced by *MAOA* and their roles in the regulation of impulsivity. Specifically, 5-HT is an inhibitory transmitter and a major pathway in serotonergic function. Most of the serotonin is produced in the brain stem, the raphe nuclei, the precursor of serotonin neurons, and then transported to the cerebral cortex, where it modulates brain function. In brain regions where serotonin production and the serotonin transporter (*SERT*) are highly expressed, such as the frontal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and the hippocampus, serotonin is primarily metabolized by *MAOA* and *","Title: Education support services for improving school engagement and academic performance of children and adolescents with a chronic health condition

Chronic health conditions can impact a child or adolescent's ability to engage in school and achieve academic success. Education support services are interventions that aim to improve school engagement and academic performance for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of education support services for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions in improving school engagement and academic performance.

A systematic review was conducted, searching several databases for studies published between January 1990 and December 2021 that evaluated education support services for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. A total of 22 studies met the inclusion criteria, including randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and observational studies.

The studies evaluated a range of education support services, including individualized education plans, school-based health clinics, case management services, and self-management programs. Overall, the review found that education support services had a positive impact on school engagement and academic performance for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions.

Several studies found that individualized education plans (IEPs) were effective in improving academic performance and school attendance for children with chronic health conditions. Other studies found that school-based health clinics were associated with better attendance and academic outcomes for children with chronic health conditions.

Case management services were also found to be effective in improving school engagement and academic performance for children with chronic health conditions. These services often involved a multidisciplinary team of healthcare providers and educators working together to address the child's medical and educational needs.

Self-management programs, which aimed to teach children and adolescents with chronic health conditions how to manage their health and academic responsibilities, were also found to be effective in improving school engagement and academic performance.

Overall, the review suggests that education support services are effective in improving school engagement and academic performance for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. However, the authors note that more research is needed to determine which types of education support services are most effective and for which populations of children and adolescents with chronic health conditions."
CD013233.pub2,Day 5 versus day 3 embryo biopsy for preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic/single gene defects,2022,November,24,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013233.pub2,Gynaecology and Fertility,Reproductive & sexual health,"Background
Assisted reproductive technology (ART) has allowed couples with a family history of a monogenic genetic disease, or a disease‐carrying gene, to reduce the chance of them having a child with the genetic disorder. This is achieved by genetically testing the embryos using an advanced process called preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic or single gene disorders (PGT‐M), such as Huntington's disease or cystic fibrosis. This current terminology (PGT‐M) has replaced the formerly‐known preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). During PGT‐M, one or more embryo cells are biopsied and analysed for genetic or chromosomal anomalies before transferring the embryos to the endometrial cavity. Biopsy for PGT‐M can be performed at day 3 of cleavage‐stage embryo development when the embryo is at the six‐ to the eight‐cell stage, with either one or two blastomeres being removed for analysis. Biopsy for PGT‐M can also be performed on day 5 of the blastocyst stage of embryo development when the embryo has 80 to 100 cells, with five to six cells being removed for analysis. Day 5 biopsy has taken over from day 3 biopsy as the most widely‐used biopsy technique; however, there is a lack of summarised evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assesses the effectiveness and safety of day 5 biopsy compared to day 3 biopsy. Since biopsy is an invasive process, whether it is carried out at day 3 or day 5 of embryo development may have different impacts on further development, implantation, pregnancy, live birth and perinatal outcomes.

Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of day 5 embryo biopsy, in comparison to day 3 biopsy, in PGT‐M in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles.

Search methods
We searched the following electronic bibliographic databases in December 2021 to identify relevant RCTs: the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGFG) Specialised Trials Register; CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO. We also handsearched grey literature, such as trial registers, relevant journals, reference lists, Google Scholar, and published conference abstracts.

Selection criteria
Eligible RCTs compared day 5 versus day 3 embryo biopsy for PGT‐M. 

Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. The primary review outcomes were live births and miscarriages. We calculated outcomes per woman/couple randomised and reported odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main results
We included one RCT involving 20 women. The evidence was of very low certainty; the main limitations of the study were serious risk of bias due to lack of blinding of study personnel, and imprecision.

We are uncertain whether day 5 embryo biopsy compared to day 3 biopsy has an effect on live births (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.26 to 8.82; 1 RCT, 20 women; very low‐certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth following day 3 biopsy was assumed to be 40%, then the chance with day 5 biopsy is between 15% and 85%. It is also uncertain whether day 5 embryo biopsy compared to day 3 biopsy has an effect on miscarriages (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.05 to 18.57; 1 RCT, 20 women; very low‐certainty evidence). 

We are uncertain whether day 5 embryo biopsy compared to day 3 biopsy has an effect on other secondary outcome measures, including viable intrauterine pregnancies (OR 2.25, 95% CI 0.38 to 13.47; 1 RCT, 20 women; very low‐certainty evidence), ectopic pregnancies (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.85; 1 RCT, 20 women; very low‐certainty evidence), stillbirths (OR not estimable as no events in either group; 1 RCT, 20 women; very low‐certainty evidence) or termination of pregnancies (OR 3.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 91.60; 1 RCT, 20 women; very low‐certainty evidence).

No studies reported on gestational age at birth, birthweight, neonatal mortality and major congenital anomaly.

Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain if there is a difference in live births and miscarriages, viable intrauterine pregnancies, ectopic pregnancies, stillbirths or termination of pregnancies between day 5 and day 3 embryo biopsy for PGT‐M. There was insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions regarding other adverse outcomes. The results should be interpreted with caution, as the evidence was of very low certainty due to limited studies, high risk of bias in the included study, and an overall low level of precision.","Day 5 versus day 3 embryo biopsy for genetic testing for single gene disorders before embryo implantation
Background

Couples who have a personal or family history of a single‐gene genetic disease, such as cystic fibrosis, can now undergo assisted reproductive technology (ART) to reduce the chance of them having a child with that same genetic disorder. This is known as preimplantation genetic testing for single gene disorders (PGT‐M). During PGT‐M, cells from a fertilised embryo are removed (biopsied) and analysed for the genetic disorder before those embryos that do not have the disorder are transferred back into the woman's uterus. The embryo cells can be biopsied at day 3 or day 5 of embryo development, with day 5 biopsy currently being the most widely used technique. Whether the embryo is biopsied at day 3 or day 5 could have different impacts on further development and implantation of the embryo, as well pregnancy and perinatal outcomes.

Key results

We found one randomised controlled trial that compared day 5 and day 3 embryo biopsy for PGT‐M in a total of 20 women undergoing ART. This study did not provide enough evidence to show whether there is a difference in the chance of live birth or miscarriage; we are very uncertain about the results.

The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth following day 3 embryo biopsy is assumed to be 40%, then the chance of live birth following day 5 biopsy is between 15% and 85%. 

Evidence on other pregnancy and perinatal outcomes was poorly reported and inconclusive.

Limitations of the evidence

We have very little confidence in the evidence because we only found one small study, and the people performing the trial knew whether the women had day 3 or day 5 biopsy. This means that the results should be interpreted cautiously, and further studies are needed to confirm findings.

How up to date is this evidence?

The evidence is current to December 2021.","Title: Day 5 versus day 3 embryo biopsy for preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic/single gene defects

Abstract: Abstract Introduction The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of day 5 biopsy compared to day 3 biopsy on the results of preimplantation genetic testing (PGT). Material and methods This study included 113 patients who underwent PGT for monogenic/single gene defects (PGDM). The study group consisted of 48 patients with PGT performed on day 5 (52 embryos biopsied) and the control group consisted of 65 patients with PGT performed on day 3 (69 embryos biopsied). All embryos were biopsied for the presence of monogenic/single gene defects by multiplex amplification followed by sequencing. Results In the study group, 28/52 embryos (53.8%) were diagnosed with at least one monogenic/single gene defect compared to 35/69 embryos (50.7%) in the control group (p = 0.8). The study group had a significantly higher proportion of embryos with a normal karyotype (41/52, 78.8%) compared to the control group (52/69, 75.4%) (p = 0.007). The study group had a significantly higher proportion of euploid embryos compared to the control group (27/52, 51.9% vs. 27/69, 38.8%, respectively; p = 0.005). Conclusion The day 5 biopsy of embryos for PGT for monogenic/single gene defects resulted in a significantly higher proportion of embryos with a normal karyotype and a higher proportion of euploid embryos compared to day 3 biopsy. However, the rate of embryos with at least one monogenic/single gene defect was similar in both groups.</s>","Title: Day 5 versus day 3 embryo biopsy for preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic/single gene defects in China.
Preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic/single gene defects is an established procedure with high success rate. Most clinicians choose the embryos in the cleavage-stage on day 3 for embryo biopsy. Some studies have shown that the biopsy would also lead to some abnormality in epigenetic or genome of the biopsied embryos. Some studies have found that embryo biopsy of the cleavage-stage may not lead to the abnormality of the blastocyst stage. Another study found no statistically significant differences in the rates of pregnancy, implantation and early abortion in the transfer of day 3 and day 5 embryo. It is still controversial. We have summarized the experience of the PGD and embryo biopsy in treating monogenic/single gene defects in China and found that the PGD and embryo biopsy only leads to increased pregnancy rate and implantation in some monogenic defects, but may lead to pregnancy loss in many defects, especially in the aneuploid embryos. Most studies suggest that PGD combined with embryo biopsy for monogenic/single gene defects can lead to the delivery of healthy baby except for Down syndrome.Sir,

A 55-year-old obese female (BMI -- 31 kg/m^2^), known to be hypertensive for 7 years, was scheduled for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Her preoperative hemoglobin was 11 g/dL, which was corrected to 13 g/dL on the day of surgery after 2 units of cross compatible blood transfusion. Postoperative ultrasound scan of neck, thorax, abdomen, and pelvis showed normal organs. Her postoperative period was uneventful. She was discharged on the 6^th^ postoperative day.

On the 14^th^ postoperative day, she had presented as an emergency with features of bleeding per vagina since 6 h. There was history of blood-stained stools following menstruation. On examination, she was pale, and a large per vaginal hematoma extending up to the umbilicus was noted \[[Figure 1](#F1){ref-type=""fig""}\]. Hematological investigations were normal; coagulation parameters were normal and hemoglobin estimation was 10.2 g/dL. Exploratory laparotomy revealed no significant intra-abdominal hematoma or any other cause of bleeding except from the site of vaginal cuff. Repair of the bleeding vaginal cuff site by two layers of continuous absorbable polyglactin suture material (No. 0, Vicryl Rapide, Ethicon Inc., Johnson and Johnson, NY, USA) was done. Postoperative period was uneventful. Her postoperative hemoglobin was 10.5 g/dL. She was discharged 8 days later.

Vaginal cuff dehiscence is known to be a rare surgical complication.\[[@ref1]\] Several other factors may increase the risk of vaginal cuff dehiscence including extremes of age, extremes of BMI, prolonged operative time, use of electrocautery and presence of endometriosis.\[[@ref1][@ref2][@ref3][@ref4][@ref5]\] To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports of bleeding per vagina as presenting symptoms following LSG. Vaginal cuff rupture with concomitant pelvic hematoma following LSG has been rarely reported.\[[@ref6]\] In these cases, bleeding per vagina usually occurred days after LSG.

Pre- or postoperative vaginal bleeding after LSG may occur in a patient who is on anti-platelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel).\[[@ref7]\] It might also occur due to the presence of pelvic endometriosis,\[[@ref8]\] uterine fibroids, or even due to hematoma from the retroperitoneal para-aortic dissection of the greater omentum.\[[@ref5]\] In this patient, we believe that the vaginal blood staining may have resulted from hematoma in the rectouterine pouch from the previous LSG and the pressure of the vaginal sutures leading to the avulsion of small vessels.

Day 5 and day 3 embryo biopsies are two commonly used methods for PGT-M. This review aims to compare the effectiveness and safety of day 5 versus day 3 embryo biopsy for PGT-M.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on studies comparing day 5 and day 3 embryo biopsy for PGT-M. A total of 11 studies (n=2,554) were included in the analysis. The primary outcome measure was the ongoing pregnancy rate per embryo transfer. Secondary outcomes included live birth rate per embryo transfer, implantation rate per embryo transfer, miscarriage rate per clinical pregnancy, and embryo biopsy-related adverse events.

The results showed that day 5 embryo biopsy was associated with higher ongoing pregnancy rates per embryo transfer compared to day 3 embryo biopsy (odds ratio (OR) 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.71; low-quality evidence). Day 5 embryo biopsy was also associated with higher live birth rates per embryo transfer (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.73; low-quality evidence) and implantation rates per embryo transfer (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.57; moderate-quality evidence) compared to day 3 embryo biopsy. There was no significant difference in miscarriage rates per clinical pregnancy between the two groups. Adverse events related to embryo biopsy were rare and did not differ significantly between the two groups.

In conclusion, based on the available evidence, day 5 embryo biopsy is associated with higher ongoing pregnancy rates, live birth rates, and implantation rates per embryo transfer compared to day 3 embryo biopsy in PGT-M cycles. However, the quality of evidence is low to moderate, and further studies are needed to confirm these findings."
CD012664.pub2,Calcium and vitamin D for increasing bone mineral density in premenopausal women,2023,January,27,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012664.pub2,Musculoskeletal,Rheumatology,"Background
Osteoporosis is a condition where bones become fragile due to low bone density and impaired bone quality. This results in fractures that lead to higher morbidity and reduced quality of life. Osteoporosis is considered a major public health concern worldwide. For this reason, preventive measurements need to be addressed throughout the life course. Exercise and a healthy diet are among the lifestyle factors that can help prevent the disease, the latter including intake of key micronutrients for bone, such as calcium and vitamin D. The evidence on whether supplementation with calcium and vitamin D improves bone mineral density (BMD) in premenopausal women is still inconclusive. In this age group, bone accrual is considered to be the goal of supplementation, so BMD is relevant for the future stages of life.

Objectives
To evaluate the benefits and harms of calcium and vitamin D supplementation, alone or in combination, to increase the BMD, reduce fractures, and report the potential adverse events in healthy premenopausal women compared to placebo.

Search methods
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was 12 April 2022.

Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials in healthy premenopausal women (with or without calcium or vitamin D deficiency) comparing supplementation of calcium or vitamin D (or both) at any dose and by any route of administration versus placebo for at least three months. Vitamin D could have been administered as cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) or ergocalciferol (vitamin D2).

Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Outcomes included total hip bone mineral density (BMD), lumbar spine BMD, quality of life, new symptomatic vertebral fractures, new symptomatic non‐vertebral fractures, withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events, all reported adverse events and additional withdrawals for any reason.

Main results
We included seven RCTs with 941 participants, of whom 138 were randomised to calcium supplementation, 110 to vitamin D supplementation, 271 to vitamin D plus calcium supplementation, and 422 to placebo. Mean age ranged from 18.1 to 42.1 years. Studies reported results for total hip or lumbar spine BMD (or both) and withdrawals for various reasons, but none reported fractures or withdrawals for adverse events or serious adverse events. Results for the reported outcomes are presented for the three comparisons: calcium versus placebo, vitamin D versus placebo, and calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo. In all comparisons, there was no clinical difference in outcomes, and the certainty of the evidence was moderate to low. Most studies were at risk of selection, performance, detection, and reporting biases.

Calcium versus placebo

Four studies compared calcium versus placebo (138 participants in the calcium group and 123 in the placebo group) with mean ages from 18.0 to 47.3 years. Calcium supplementation may have little to no effect on total hip or lumbar spine BMD after 12 months in three studies and after six months in one study (total hip BMD: mean difference (MD) −0.04 g/cm2, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.11 to 0.03; I2 = 71%; 3 studies, 174 participants; low‐certainty evidence; lumbar spine BMD: MD 0 g/cm2, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.06; I2 = 71%; 4 studies, 202 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Calcium alone supplementation does not reduce or increase the withdrawals in the trials (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.16; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 261 participants: moderate‐certainty evidence).

Vitamin D versus placebo

Two studies compared vitamin D versus placebo (110 participants in the vitamin D group and 79 in the placebo group), with mean ages from 18.0 to 32.7 years. These studies reported lumbar spine BMD as a mixture of MDs and percent of change and we were unable to pool the results. In the original studies, there were no differences in lumbar BMD between groups. Vitamin D alone supplementation does not reduce or increase withdrawals for any reason between groups (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.19; moderate‐certainty evidence).

Calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo

Two studies compared calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo (271 participants in the calcium plus vitamin D group and 270 in the placebo group; 220 participants from Woo 2007 and 50 participants from Islam 2010). The mean age range was 18.0 to 36 years. These studies measured different anatomic areas, one study reported total hip BMD and the other study reported lumbar spine BMD; therefore, data were not pooled for this outcome. The individual studies found no difference between groups in percent of change on total hip BMD (−0.03, 95% CI −0.06 to 0; moderate‐certainty evidence), and lumbar spine BMD (MD 0.01, 95% CI −0.01 to 0.03; moderate‐certainty evidence). Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation may not reduce or increase withdrawals for any reason (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.35; I2 = 72%; 2 studies, 541 participants; low‐certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions
Our results do not support the isolated or combined use of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in healthy premenopausal women as a public health intervention to improve BMD in the total hip or lumbar spine, and therefore it is unlikely to have a benefit for the prevention of fractures (vertebral and non‐vertebral).

The evidence found suggests that there is no need for future studies in the general population of premenopausal women; however, studies focused on populations with a predisposition to diseases related to bone metabolism, or with low bone mass or osteoporosis diagnosed BMD would be useful.","Calcium and vitamin D for improving bone health in healthy premenopausal women
Key messages

The evidence suggests that calcium, vitamin D, or calcium plus vitamin D supplementation has no effect on bone mineral density at any site (hip or spine) in healthy premenopausal women.

What is osteoporosis?

Osteoporosis is characterised by low levels of calcium and other types of minerals in the bones (called bone mineral density). This causes holes to form inside the bones and the outer walls of the bone to become thin making the bones more fragile, which may lead to increased fractures and breaks.

Osteoporosis constitutes a major public health problem and contributes to more than 8.9 million broken bones annually, which means that on average, an osteoporotic fracture occurs every three seconds. Supplements of calcium and vitamin D are often recommended for women after menopause (although not everyone agrees), but adequate supplementation of calcium and vitamin D is always recommended in institutionalised people (e.g. people living in care homes) and people taking osteoporosis treatment. Little is known about the effect of calcium and vitamin D on the bone density of women who have not yet started menopause. There are few studies in this age group and the results are inconclusive. In this age group, increasing bone strength and health is considered the goal of supplementation, so BMD is relevant.

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to determine if calcium and vitamin D were able to increase the mineral content of bones and reduce the risk of fractures, and to report potential side effects of supplementation.

What did we do?

We searched medical databases for well‐designed clinical studies of calcium and vitamin D supplementation alone or in combination compared with placebo (dummy treatment) in healthy women aged 18 to 45 years (premenopausal). We analysed three combinations: calcium versus placebo, vitamin D versus placebo, and calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo, administered for at least three months. We looked at their effects on increasing minerals in the bones of the hip and spine, if the women had vertebral (backbone) or any other fractures during the study, effects on quality of life, and if these women had to stop the supplementation because of side effects.

What did we find?

We included seven studies with 941 healthy premenopausal women with an average age per study of 18 to 42.1 years. The women were randomly assigned to receive supplementation of calcium, vitamin D, or vitamin D plus calcium, or placebo.

Main results

There was no difference in bone mineral density in any of the groups being supplemented with calcium, vitamin D, or calcium plus vitamin D compared with placebo. The studies did not report fractures (from any anatomical site), quality of life, or stopping the supplementation for side effects.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

The common limitations in the methods of the studies included small numbers of participants, studies, and data; problems in adherence to treatment, participants may have known which treatment they received; and lack of information for withdrawals from treatment. The funding for the studies was provided by institutional, academic, government, and pharmaceutical industries.

How up to date is this evidence?

Abstract: Objective 
To investigate the effects of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on bone mineral density (BMD) in premenopausal women. 
 
 
Methods 
This is a prospective randomized controlled trial. A total of 104 premenopausal women aged 45-50 years were recruited from community health centers. Participants were randomly divided into two groups, control group (n=52) and treatment group (n=52). Participants in the control group received calcium (700 mg/d) and vitamin D3 (400 IU/d). Participants in the treatment group received calcium (700 mg/d) and vitamin D3 (400 IU/d), and alendronate sodium tablets (70 mg/d). The treatment lasted for 24 weeks. BMD was measured at baseline and after 24 weeks. 
 
 
Results 
After 24 weeks, the lumbar spine BMD of participants in the treatment group increased by 3.12% (P<0.05), which was higher than that of the control group (2.03%, P<0.05). The femoral neck BMD of participants in the treatment group increased by 2.58% (P<0.05), which was higher than that of the control group (1.58%, P<0.05). The percentage change of the lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD in the treatment group was higher than that in the control group (P<0.05). 
 
 
Conclusions 
The combination of calcium, vitamin D and alendronate sodium tablets has a greater effect on the increase of lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD in premenopausal women.

However, a study on a total of 238 premenopausal women performed by Kwon Sik You and Won Sun Choi (2009) \[[@ref26]\] concluded that calcium supplementation did not help in improving the BMD. This study included 123 patients undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) and 116 women with an underlying medical condition, i.e. polycystic ovaries. The main limitation of this study is that they administered calcium supplements in three doses of 600 mg/day; however, the optimum amount and frequency for calcium supplementation for BMD improvement remains still undefined.

The most recent review on calcium supplementation showed that there was insufficient evidence to support the benefits of calcium supplementation on bone health \[[@ref19]\]. However, there was a statistically and clinically significant improvement of the BMD after a period of 1-2 years of calcium supplementation.

However, supplementation of vitamin D along with calcium supplementation would be a more effective measure than calcium supplementation alone to increase the BMD \[[@ref19]\]. The recommended daily allowance (RDA) of calcium is less than 500 mg/day and the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of vitamin D is less than 300 IU/day for Indian women \[[@ref19]\]. For the majority of South Asians, the vitamin D intake in spite of a higher intake of foodstuffs is far below the sufficient level \[[@ref19]\].

A single trial from Nigeria assessed the effect of the supplementation of 300 mg calcium per day with or without 400 IU vitamin D per day on the BMD of 368 women, 20 to 45 years of age, and found a significant improvement in the BMD of the femur and tibia after supplementation of vitamin D, irrespective of the calcium supplementation \[[@ref27]\].

### Zinc supplementation {#sec3-5}

Potentially, the effect of zinc supplementation alone on the BMD is less compared to the combination of calcium and vitamin D. There are only three trials published in the literature regarding the effect of zinc supplementation on the BMD. One randomized controlled trial from Turkey was performed to find the effect of zinc supplementation (15 mg zinc as gluconate or acetate) on the BMD, fat free mass, and waist. A total of 100 non-obese peri-menopausal women were divided into two groups. The first group received the supplements of 15 mg elemental zinc gluconate and the second group received the same amount of elemental zinc acetate for a period of 2 months. The study did not show any effect on the fat-free mass or the waist among the two groups. However, there was a statistically significant effect on the BMD at the lumbar spine in the group receiving zinc gluconate whereas the group receiving zinc acetate did not show any effect. Thus, it can be concluded that the addition of elemental zinc gluconate supplement for 6 weeks has a BMD-enhancing effect among peri-menopausal women \[[@ref28]\] \[[Table 3](#T3){ref-type=""table""}\].

However, in another trial performed in Turkey by Karasu *et al*. (2014) \[[@ref29]\], zinc supplementation at a dose of 15 mg of elemental zinc was given for 2 months but did not show a beneficial effect on the lumbar BMD. Their sample included 160 women who were divided into two groups. One group was treated with 15 mg of elemental zinc in an oral preparation; an equal number of subjects were allocated to the second group who were given placebo. This trial concluded that there was no preventive effect of zinc supplementation on the BMD loss during menopause \[[Table 3](#T3){ref-type=""table""}\].

The other trial from Saudi Arabia studied the effect of 2 mg/kg of elemental zinc in 20 women for 12 weeks and did not show any significant effect on the BMD \[[@ref30]\]. A meta-analysis also confirmed the lack of beneficial effect of zinc supplementation on the bone mass or density \[[@ref","A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on bone mineral density (BMD) in premenopausal women. A total of 13 randomized controlled trials with a total of 2,150 participants were included in the analysis. The studies had varying doses of calcium and vitamin D, ranging from 500 to 1,500 mg/day and 400 to 1,200 IU/day, respectively.

The results showed that calcium and vitamin D supplementation had a small but statistically significant effect on BMD in premenopausal women. The overall effect size for lumbar spine BMD was 0.05 (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.10) and for hip BMD was 0.04 (95% CI, -0.01 to 0.08). Subgroup analyses suggested that the effect was more pronounced in studies that used higher doses of calcium and vitamin D, had longer durations of supplementation, and included participants with lower baseline BMD.

Overall, the review suggests that calcium and vitamin D supplementation may have a small positive effect on BMD in premenopausal women, particularly when higher doses and longer durations of supplementation are used. However, the clinical significance of these findings remains unclear, and further research is needed to determine the optimal dosages and durations of supplementation to maximize the benefits on bone health in this population.

CD012557.pub3,Baclofen for alcohol use disorder,2023,January,13,3,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012557.pub3,Drugs and Alcohol,"Tobacco, drugs & alcohol","Background
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is one of the most widespread psychiatric disorders leading to detrimental consequences to people with this disorder and others. Worldwide, the prevalence of heavy episodic drinking (30‐day prevalence of at least one occasion of 60 g of pure alcohol intake among current drinkers) is estimated at 20% and the prevalence of AUD at 5% of the adult general population, with highest prevalence in Europe and North America. Therapeutic approaches, including pharmacotherapy, play an important role in treating people with AUD.

This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2018.

Objectives
To evaluate the benefits and harms of baclofen on achieving and maintaining abstinence or reducing alcohol consumption in people with AUD compared to placebo, no treatment or any other pharmacological relapse prevention treatment.

Search methods
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was 22 November 2021.

Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least four weeks' treatment duration and 12 weeks' overall study duration comparing baclofen for AUD treatment with placebo, no treatment or other treatments.

Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. relapse, 2. frequency of use, 3. amount of use, 4. adverse events, 5. dropouts from treatment and 6. dropouts from treatment due to adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 7. craving, 8. anxiety, 9. depression and 10. frequency of most relevant adverse events.

Main results
We included 17 RCTs (1818 participants) with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition or International Classification of Diseases 10th edition criteria. Mean age was 46.5 years and 70% were men. Ten studies compared baclofen to placebo or another medication; seven compared two baclofen doses to placebo or another medication. Globally, 15 studies compared baclofen to placebo, two baclofen to acamprosate and two baclofen to naltrexone. In 16 studies, participants received psychosocial treatments.

We judged most studies at low risk of selection, performance, detection (subjective outcome), attrition and reporting bias.

Ten studies detoxified participants before treatment; in seven studies, participants were still drinking at the beginning of treatment. Treatment duration was 12 weeks for 15 RCTs and longer in two studies. Baclofen daily dose was 30 mg to 300 mg: 10 RCTs used low doses (30 mg or less); eight RCTs medium doses (above 30 and 100 mg or less) and four RCTs high doses (above 100 mg).

Compared to placebo, moderate‐certainty evidence found that baclofen probably decreases the risk to relapse (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.99; 12 studies, 1057 participants). This result was confirmed among detoxified participants but not among other subgroups of participants.

High‐certainty evidence found that baclofen increases the percentage of days abstinent (mean difference (MD) 9.07, 95% CI 3.30 to 14.85; 16 studies, 1273 participants). This result was confirmed among all subgroups of participants except non‐detoxified or those who received medium doses.

There was no difference between baclofen and placebo in the other primary outcomes: heavy drinking days (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.18, 95% CI −0.48 to 0.11; 13 studies, 840 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); number of drinks per drinking days (MD −0.45, 95% CI −1.20 to 0.30; 9 studies, 392 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); number of participants with at least one adverse event (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.11; 10 studies, 738 participants; high‐certainty evidence); dropouts (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.03; 17 studies, 1563 participants; high‐certainty evidence); dropouts due to adverse events (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.18; 16 studies, 1499 participants; high‐certainty evidence). These results were confirmed by subgroup analyses except than for the dropouts that resulted lower among participants who received high doses of baclofen and studies longer than 12 weeks.

Compared to placebo, there was no difference in craving (SMD −0.16, 95% CI −0.37 to 0.04; 17 studies, 1275 participants), anxiety (MD −0.01, 95% CI −0.14 to 0.11; 15 studies, 1123 participants) and depression (SMD 0.07, 95% CI −0.12 to 0.27; 11 studies, 1029 participants).

Concerning the specific adverse events, baclofen increases fatigue, dizziness, somnolence/sedation, dry mouth, paraesthesia and muscle spasms/rigidity. There was no difference in the other adverse events.

Compared to acamprosate, one study (60 participants) found no differences in any outcomes but the evidence was very uncertain: relapse (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.20; very low‐certainty evidence); number of participants with at least one adverse event (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.69; very low‐certainty evidence); dropouts (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.46; very low‐certainty evidence); dropouts due to adverse events (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.87; very low‐certainty evidence) and craving (MD 5.80, 95% CI −11.84 to 23.44); and all the adverse events evaluated.

Compared to naltrexone, baclofen may increase the risk of relapse (RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.12 to 5.56; 1 study, 60 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and decrease the number of participants with at least one adverse event (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.80; 2 studies, 80 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) but the evidence is very uncertain. One study (60 participants) found no difference between baclofen and naltrexone in the dropouts at the end of treatment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.10; very low‐certainty evidence), craving (MD 2.08, 95% CI −3.71 to 7.87), and all the adverse events evaluated.

Authors' conclusions
Baclofen likely reduces the risk of relapse to any drinking and increases the percentage of abstinent days, mainly among detoxified participants. It does not increase the number of participants with at least one adverse event, those who dropout for any reason or due to adverse events. It probably does not reduce number of heavy drinking days and the number of drinks per drinking days. Current evidence suggests that baclofen may help people with AUD in maintaining abstinence. The results of comparisons of baclofen with acamprosate and naltrexone were mainly based on only one study.","Baclofen for alcohol use disorder
Key messages of the review

We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of baclofen for treating people with alcohol use disorder (AUD) in order to achieve and maintain abstinence (stopping drinking) or reduce alcohol consumption.

Current evidence suggests that it may help people with AUD in maintaining abstinence, particularly in people who are already detoxified. The results of comparisons with other medications were mainly based on a single study and do not allow us to draw conclusions.

Review topics and aims

AUD is one of the most widespread psychiatric disorders, leading to specific physical, mood, learning and memory problems, and consequences for overall well‐being and health. The misuse of alcohol is one of the biggest risks to health worldwide, causing 20% to 30% of oesophageal (food pipe) cancer, liver disease, epilepsy (fits), motor vehicle accidents, murders and other intentional injuries.

For many years, the main treatments for AUD have been psychosocial strategies (helping people to recognise that they need help), but using only psychosocial treatments has limited success. A high proportion of people with AUD do not respond to treatment at all, and those who do respond do not stay alcohol‐free in the long‐term. Medications such as baclofen could play an important role in treating people with AUD.

Review methods

We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies where people were allocated at random to one of two or more treatments or control groups) evaluating the effect of baclofen in reducing alcohol consumption or in achieving and maintaining abstinence (or both) when compared to placebo (inactive medication) or other medications. We pooled similar studies and evaluated the effects dividing the studies according to the doses of baclofen, duration of treatment, and alcohol consumption and the beginning of treatment (i.e. into detoxified or non‐detoxified participants on the basis if they were abstinent or were still drinking at the beginning of treatment).

Summary of results

We found 17 studies with 1818 participants with AUD. The duration of the interventions ranged from three months to one year. Five studies were in the USA; two each in Australia, France, India and Italy; and one each in Germany, Israel and the Netherlands.

Doses of baclofen were 30 mg a day to 300 mg a day, and, in some cases, the doses were increased during the treatment. Seventeen studies compared baclofen to placebo (dummy medication), two compared baclofen to acamprosate (medication used to treat AUD), and two compared baclofen to naltrexone (medication used to treat AUD).

Compared with placebo, baclofen probably helps people with AUD at reducing the risk of relapse and increasing the rate of abstinent days. These effects may be more evident among detoxified than non‐detoxified people with AUD. Baclofen probably makes no difference in the rate of heavy drinking days; drinks per drinking days; craving, anxiety and depression severity; number of participants who dropout from treatment for any reason; those who dropped out due to adverse events (side effects); or the number of participants with at least one adverse event. Baclofen may increase adverse events such as fatigue, vertigo (a feeling that everything is spinning), sleepiness, dry mouth, numbness and muscle spasm but we found no differences between baclofen and placebo for other adverse events.

Certainty of evidence
The certainty of evidence (how much we can be confident that the evidence is reliable) was high for results about the percentage of days of abstinence, the number of participants with at least one adverse event, people dropping out of the studies for any reason, and people dropping out due to adverse events. The certainty of the evidence was moderate for results about returning to any drinking, heavy drinking days and number of drinks per drinking days.

Search date
The evidence is current to November 2021. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2018.
","Title: Baclofen for alcohol use disorder

Abstract: Baclofen is a GABAB receptor agonist, which may be a useful treatment for alcohol use disorder.</s>","Title: Baclofen for alcohol use disorder.* This study, which was conducted in two phase II clinical trials, looked into the role of baclofen in alcohol dependence in two different patient groups: inpatients with alcohol dependence and a group of alcoholics who attended group therapy sessions, after discharge. In both the groups, baclofen induced a similar significant reduction in the amount of alcohol consumption. Baclofen also induced significant reductions both in the frequency and in the severity of the craving, the number of relapses, and days of hospitalization for detoxification \[[@B36-pharmaceuticals-12-00142],[@B37-pharmaceuticals-12-00142]\]. Another recent published study, which was conducted in the hospital setting and showed significant reduction in craving in alcohol-dependent patients, suggests a promising role of baclofen in AUD therapy.

### 3.1.10. Rivastigmine {#sec3dot1dot10-pharmaceuticals-12-00142}

Rivastigmine has been studied extensively in recent years, as it not only acts on the central cholinergic system but also modulates nicotinic and M2 receptors \[[@B38-pharmaceuticals-12-00142]\]. A few studies have studied the effects of this drug on alcohol consumption in animal models. A recent study in mice has shown the ability of rivastigmine to decrease the locomotor activity induced by alcohol and its direct rewarding effect in mice. Rivastigmine also decreased the alcohol-induced hyperactivity of the central nervous system and conditioned place preference in mice \[[@B39-pharmaceuticals-12-00142]\]. It also reduced alcohol intake in mice, rats, and deer mice (*Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii*) \[[@B40-pharmaceuticals-12-00142],[@B41-pharmaceuticals-12-00142]\], and suppressed alcohol-induced behavioral abnormalities such as aggression and alcohol withdrawal \[[@B42-pharmaceuticals-12-00142],[@B43-pharmaceuticals-12-00142]\]. However, in rats, no effect was found on operant responding for alcohol \[[@B44-pharmaceuticals-12-00142]\].

A recent published review on the use of rivastigmine in AUD, which included randomized controlled trials, case, open-label studies, and systematic review, concluded that it is a promising drug in treating alcohol dependence. In the review, however, only nine randomized placebo-controlled trials were analyzed and, of them, only three studies reported a statistically significant effect of rivastigmine on drinking outcomes, and only two, in patients with alcohol dependence according to the DSM-IV-TR. These studies, however, were carried out in only a few patients and, therefore, do not provide strong evidence supporting the use of rivastigmine \[[@B45-pharmaceuticals-12-00142]\].

### 3.1.11. Vildagliptin {#sec3dot1dot11-pharmaceuticals-12-00142}

Vildagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor, which has been tested in alcohol dependent animal models and in alcohol-treated rats for its anti-craving properties. The main target of this drug is glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, which are produced in the intestinal L cells in response to food intake. Moreover, DPP4 has been demonstrated to have a large expression in the mesolimbic dopamine system, and thus, an inhibition of DPP4 might increase endogenous GLP-1, which, in turn, can modulate glutamatergic transmission in the cortico-accumbens projections and result in an attenuation of alcohol-induced dopamine efflux \[[@B46-pharmaceuticals-12-00142],[@B47-pharmaceuticals-12-00142],[@B48-pharmaceuticals-12-00142]\]. Vildagliptin has shown promising results in animal models of alcohol dependence \[[@B49-pharmaceuticals-12-00142],[@B50-pharmaceuticals-12-00142]\]. Recently, Kam et al. (2019) have performed a phase 2 clinical trial to investigate the effects of vildagliptin in alcohol withdrawal symptoms. This study, conducted in patients of both sexes (*n* = 180) with alcohol dependence, failed to find any beneficial effect of vildagliptin on withdrawal symptoms and craving \[[@B51-pharmaceuticals-12-00142]\].

### 3.1.12. Galantamine/Reminyl {#sec3dot1dot12-pharmaceuticals-12-00142}

Galantamine is a nonselective inhibitor of acetyl cholinesterase (AChE","Baclofen is a medication that has been used for the treatment of muscle spasticity, but it has also been studied as a potential treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Here is a review of the evidence on baclofen for AUD:

A systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2017 evaluated the efficacy and safety of baclofen for the treatment of AUD. The authors identified six randomized controlled trials with a total of 633 participants. The review found that baclofen was associated with a significant reduction in the number of drinking days per week, but not with a significant reduction in the amount of alcohol consumed per drinking day or the number of heavy drinking days per week. Baclofen was also associated with a higher rate of adverse events compared to placebo, including sedation, dizziness, and fatigue.

A Cochrane review published in 2015 also evaluated the efficacy and safety of baclofen for the treatment of AUD. The review identified three randomized controlled trials with a total of 253 participants. The review found that baclofen was associated with a significant reduction in the number of drinking days per week and the number of heavy drinking days per week, but not with a significant reduction in the amount of alcohol consumed per drinking day. Baclofen was also associated with a higher rate of adverse events compared to placebo, including sedation, dizziness, and gastrointestinal disturbances.

Overall, the evidence suggests that baclofen may be effective for reducing the frequency of drinking days in individuals with AUD, but it is not consistently effective for reducing the amount of alcohol consumed per drinking day or the number of heavy drinking days per week. Additionally, baclofen is associated with a higher rate of adverse events compared to placebo. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dosing regimen and the long-term safety and efficacy of baclofen for AUD."
CD013519.pub2,Acupuncture for treating overactive bladder in adults,2022,September,23,2,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013519.pub2,Incontinence,Urology,"Background
Overactive bladder is a common, long‐term symptom complex, which includes frequency of micturition, urgency with or without associated incontinence and nocturia. Around 11% of the population have symptoms, with this figure increasing with age. Symptoms can be linked to social anxiety and adaptive behavioural change. The cost of treating overactive bladder is considerable, with current treatments varying in effectiveness and being associated with side effects. Acupuncture has been suggested as an alternative treatment.

Objectives
To assess the effects of acupuncture for treating overactive bladder in adults, and to summarise the principal findings of relevant economic evaluations.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (including In‐Process, Epub Ahead of Print, Daily), ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP (searched 14 May 2022). We also searched the Allied and Complementary Medicine database (AMED) and bibliographic databases where knowledge of the Chinese language was necessary: China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI); Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP) and WANFANG (China Online Journals), as well as the reference lists of relevant articles. 

Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs and cross‐over RCTs assessing the effects of acupuncture for treating overactive bladder in adults.

Data collection and analysis
Four review authors formed pairs to assess study eligibility and extract data. Both pairs used Covidence software to perform screening and data extraction. We assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's risk of bias tool and assessed heterogeneity using the Chi2 testand I2 statistic generated within the meta‐analyses. We used a fixed‐effect model within the meta‐analyses unless there was a moderate or high level of heterogeneity, where we employed a random‐effects model. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main results
We included 15 studies involving 1395 participants in this review (14 RCTs and one quasi‐RCT). All included studies raised some concerns regarding risk of bias. Blinding of participants to treatment group was only achieved in 20% of studies, we considered blinding of outcome assessors and allocation concealment to be low risk in only 25% of the studies, and random sequence generation to be either unclear or high risk in more than 50% of the studies.

Acupuncture versus no treatment

One study compared acupuncture to no treatment. The evidence is very uncertain regarding the effect of acupuncture compared to no treatment in curing or improving overactive bladder symptoms and on the number of minor adverse events (both very low‐certainty evidence). The study report explicitly stated that no major adverse events occurred. The study did not report on the presence or absence of urinary urgency, episodes of urinary incontinence, daytime urinary frequency or episodes of nocturia.

Acupuncture versus sham acupuncture

Five studies compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of acupuncture on curing or improving overactive bladder symptoms compared to sham acupuncture (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.03 to 0.31; 3 studies; 151 participants; I2 = 65%; very low‐certainty evidence). All five studies explicitly stated that there were no major adverse events observed during the study. Moderate‐certainty evidence suggests that acupuncture probably makes no difference to the incidence of minor adverse events compared to sham acupuncture (risk ratio (RR) 1.28, 95% CI 0.30 to 5.36; 4 studies; 222 participants; I² = 0%). Only one small study reported data for the presence or absence of urgency and for episodes of nocturia. The evidence is of very low certainty for both of these outcomes and in both cases the lower confidence interval is implausible. Moderate‐certainty evidence suggests there is probably little or no difference in episodes of urinary incontinence between acupuncture and sham acupuncture (mean difference (MD) 0.55, 95% CI ‐1.51 to 2.60; 2 studies; 121 participants; I2 = 57%). Two studies recorded data regarding daytime urinary frequency but we could not combine them in a meta‐analysis due to differences in methodologies (very low‐certainty evidence).

Acupuncture versus medication

Eleven studies compared acupuncture with medication. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that acupuncture may slightly increase how many people's overactive bladder symptoms are cured or improved compared to medication (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.43; 5 studies; 258 participants; I2 = 19%). Low‐certainty evidence suggests that acupuncture may reduce the incidence of minor adverse events when compared to medication (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.45; 8 studies; 1004 participants; I² = 51%). The evidence is uncertain regarding the effect of acupuncture on the presence or absence of urinary urgency (MD ‐0.40, 95% CI ‐0.56 to ‐0.24; 2 studies; 80 participants; I2 = 0%; very low‐certainty evidence) and episodes of urinary incontinence (MD ‐0.33, 95% CI ‐2.75 to 2.09; 1 study; 20 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) compared to medication. Low‐certainty evidence suggests there may be little to no effect of acupuncture compared to medication in terms of daytime urinary frequency (MD 0.73, 95% CI ‐0.39 to 1.85; 4 studies; 360 participants; I2 = 28%). Acupuncture may slightly reduce the number of nocturia episodes compared to medication (MD ‐0.50, 95% CI ‐0.65 to ‐0.36; 2 studies; 80 participants; I2 = 0%, low‐certainty evidence).

There were no incidences of major adverse events in any of the included studies. However, major adverse events are rare in acupuncture trials and the numbers included in this review may be insufficient to detect these events.

Authors' conclusions
The evidence is very uncertain about the effect acupuncture has on cure or improvement of overactive bladder symptoms compared to no treatment. It is uncertain if there is any difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture in cure or improvement of overactive bladder symptoms. This review provides low‐certainty evidence that acupuncture may result in a slight increase in cure or improvement of overactive bladder symptoms when compared with medication and may reduce the incidence of minor adverse events.

These conclusions must remain tentative until the completion of larger, higher‐quality studies that use relevant, comparable outcomes. Timing and frequency of treatment, point selection, application and long‐term follow‐up are other areas relevant for research.","Acupuncture for treating overactive bladder in adults
Review question

Is acupuncture a safe and effective treatment for treating overactive bladder in adults?

Background

Overactive bladder is the term used to describe a group of urinary symptoms, including an urgent need to pass urine, frequent voiding (emptying), urinary incontinence and waking one or more times at night to pass urine (nocturia). Sufferers may have one or more of these symptoms. Overactive bladder is a common complaint and can affect both men and women of any age, though it is more common in older people. Treatment can include bladder education, pelvic floor exercises, medication, botox injections into the bladder wall, sacral neuromodulation and surgery.

Acupuncture refers to the practice of inserting fine needles into defined points on the body in order to achieve an improvement in health. It is used in a wide range of conditions and has been suggested as a possible treatment for overactive bladder symptoms.

How up‐to‐date is this review?

This review includes all studies that met our eligibility criteria, published up to 14 May 2022. We are aware of six ongoing studies and two studies that we cannot obtain in full, which were not included in our review.

Study characteristics

We included 15 studies involving a total of 1395 participants with overactive bladder. The majority of the studies had small numbers of participants and we had some reservations about the study designs, processes or both in the majority of the studies.

Study funding sources

Of the 15 included studies, four were supported by Chinese Government‐funded research grants and two were funded by Higher Education institutions. The open access publishing fee for one study was paid by the Norwegian Acupuncture Association. Eight studies did not report any source of funding.

Key results

The different methods used by the studies made the comparison of results difficult.

Compared to no treatment, the effect of acupuncture on curing or improving overactive bladder symptoms and the amount of minor side effects is very uncertain. No major adverse events took place. The were no reports on the effect of acupuncture compared to no treatment with regard to reducing urinary urgency, daytime urinary frequency, episodes of urinary incontinence or episodes of nocturia.

Compared to sham (fake) acupuncture, the effect of acupuncture on curing or improving overactive bladder symptoms is uncertain. Acupuncture probably makes little or no difference to the number of minor adverse events compared to sham acupuncture. No major adverse events took place in any of the studies. The evidence is very uncertain regarding the effect of acupuncture on the presence of absence of urinary urgency, daytime urinary frequency or episodes of nocturia. There is probably no difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture in terms of episodes of urinary incontinence.

Acupuncture may result in a slight improvement in overactive bladder symptoms when compared with medication and may result in a reduced number of minor adverse events. No major adverse events took place. The effect of acupuncture compared to medication is very uncertain with regard to urinary urgency and episodes of incontinence. Acupuncture may have the same effect as medication on urinary frequency and may slightly reduce episodes of nocturia.

Certainty of the evidence

The majority of the evidence in this review is of very low or low certainty because the included studies had flaws in their design and/or execution. Many had small numbers of participants and were conducted over a short period of time. Given these issues, it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding how effective acupuncture is for treating overactive bladder. Further well‐designed, large‐scale studies are required to answer this question.

Acupuncture for treating overactive bladder in adults</s>","Title: Acupuncture for treating overactive bladder in adults.
Overactive bladder is a chronic bladder condition, which affects up to 20% of the population, with a considerable emotional burden and substantial financial implication. Several medications and surgical management have varying degrees of effectiveness in managing overactive bladder. Acupuncture, a form of herbal medicine, has been widely prescribed for managing a wide range of bladder problems. To assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for treating overactive bladder in adults in the community setting. We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, and PubMed; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE, AMED, AMED In-Process & Non-indexed Citations; CINAHL; PsycINFO; Science Citation Index (EXPANDEDSR) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S). We used the search strategy developed by the Cochrane Incontinence Group. The date of the most recent searches of the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register was 22 January 2013. All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials examining the effect of acupuncture in the management of overactive bladder were included. Studies were assessed for methodological quality and data were entered onto review software (Review Manager (RevMan) 5.2, The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2012). This was carried out independently by two authors. The search identified 23 potentially relevant papers for consideration, of which five fulfilled inclusion criteria, comprising 617 participants in total. Three of four studies found acupuncture to be beneficial or significantly better than placebo; however, the fourth study did not find a benefit. One study was rated at low risk of bias, the other three at high risk of bias. Due to heterogeneity within the studies, meta-analysis of the data was not performed but evidence is summarised narratively. With regard to objective outcomes, acupuncture was consistently superior to placebo. Four out of five studies used participant-reported outcomes of incontinence episodes per 24 hours; however, significant adverse effects, predominantly bruising, were reported in two of the studies. Only two out of four studies recorded the number of urinary tract infections and both reported a reduction in urinary tract infections. Acupuncture is effective in reducing urinary frequency, nocturia and incontinence episodes per participant by up to 50%. Side-effects include bruising, bleeding, and the temporary worsening of underlying conditions, such as cardiac and respiratory illness, or conditions that affect blood pressure. The evidence is insufficient to recommend acupuncture within routine practice.Introduction {#Sec1}

Firefighters are exposed to several hazardous agents with known toxic effects on health. Occupational exposures to toxic agents like carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter are among the most studied, whereas risks in exposure to organic solvents are unknown. Organic solvents, and in particular toluene, are a component of many chemical processes, including the production and use of synthetic textiles, paints, adhesives, sealants, adhesives, varnishes, gasoline additives, degreasing powders, fuel oils, and plastics, in an increasing number of products. In addition, solvents may be used as solvents in cleaning agents, fire extinguishers, as solvents in cleaning agents, and flame retardants \[[@CR1]\]. Organic solvents have both acute and chronic toxic effects on multiple organ systems, and inhalation of these agents by humans may result in toxic effects \[[@CR2]\]. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has classified organic solvents into four classes based on their possible acute and chronic toxicity (Table [1](#Tab1){ref-type=""table""}). In all three classes of organic solvents included in this review, there is some or definite evidence of reproductive effects in humans and sufficient evidence of reproductive toxicity in laboratory animals \[[@CR2], [@CR3]\], but the evidence regarding reproductive or developmental toxicity of occupational inhalation exposure to organic solvents is currently conflicting.Table 1Classifications of organic solvents according to toxic effectsOrganic solventsCategoryMode of actionAcute toxicityChronic toxicity1.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common condition characterized by symptoms such as urinary urgency, frequency, and incontinence. Acupuncture has been used as a complementary and alternative therapy for OAB. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for treating OAB in adults.

Methods:
Electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the use of acupuncture for OAB in adults. The quality of studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcomes were changes in bladder diary variables and patient-reported outcomes. The secondary outcomes were adverse events and quality of life.

Results:
Six RCTs with a total of 457 participants were included in the review. Four studies were of high quality and two were of moderate quality. The meta-analysis showed that acupuncture was more effective than sham acupuncture or no intervention for improving urinary frequency and urgency, but not for improving urinary incontinence. Acupuncture was also associated with a greater reduction in the number of voids per 24 hours compared to sham acupuncture or no intervention. No serious adverse events were reported in any of the included studies.

Conclusion:
The available evidence suggests that acupuncture is a safe and effective therapy for reducing urinary frequency and urgency in adults with OAB. However, further high-quality studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm these findings and investigate the effects of acupuncture on other outcomes such as urinary incontinence and quality of life."
CD012032.pub3,Reconstructive surgery for treating pressure ulcers,2022,October,13,3,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012032.pub3,Wounds,Wounds,"Background
There are several possible interventions for managing pressure ulcers (sometimes referred to as pressure injuries), ranging from pressure‐relieving measures, such as repositioning, to reconstructive surgery. The surgical approach is usually reserved for recalcitrant wounds (where the healing process has stalled, or the wound is not responding to treatment) or wounds with full‐thickness skin loss and exposure of deeper structures such as muscle fascia or bone. Reconstructive surgery commonly involves wound debridement followed by filling the wound with new tissue. Whilst this is an accepted means of ulcer management, the benefits and harms of different surgical approaches, compared with each other or with non‐surgical treatments, are unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2016.

Objectives
To assess the effects of different types of reconstructive surgery for treating pressure ulcers (category/stage II or above), compared with no surgery or alternative reconstructive surgical approaches, in any care setting.

Search methods
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was January 2022.

Selection criteria
Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed reconstructive surgery in the treatment of pressure ulcers.

Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected the studies, extracted study data, assessed the risk of bias and undertook GRADE assessments. We would have involved a third review author in case of disagreement.

Main results
We identified one RCT conducted in a hospital setting in the USA. It enrolled 20 participants aged between 20 and 70 years with stage IV ischial or sacral pressure ulcers (involving full‐thickness skin and tissue loss). The study compared two reconstructive techniques for stage IV pressure ulcers: conventional flap surgery and cone of pressure flap surgery, in which a large portion of the flap tip is de‐epithelialised and deeply inset to obliterate dead space. There were no clear data for any of our outcomes, although we extracted some information on complete wound healing, wound dehiscence, pressure ulcer recurrence and wound infection. We graded the evidence for these outcomes as very low‐certainty. The study provided no data for any other outcomes.

Authors' conclusions
Currently there is very little randomised evidence on the role of reconstructive surgery in pressure ulcer management, although it is considered a priority area. More rigorous and robust research is needed to explore this intervention.","What are the benefits and risks of reconstructive surgery for treating pressure ulcers?
Key messages

‐ We are uncertain about the benefits and risks of reconstructive surgery (sometimes known as plastic surgery) for treating pressure ulcers (sometimes known as bedsores, pressure sores or pressure injuries). 

‐ We found one small study (20 participants) that investigated reconstructive surgery in deep, hard‐to‐heal pressure ulcers, but we were unable to reach any conclusions from the reported results.

‐ Larger, well‐designed studies are needed to explore this priority area.

What are pressure ulcers?

Pressure ulcers are skin and tissue injuries that are usually caused by people staying in the same position for long periods of time. When external pressure is constantly applied to parts of the body, blood flow is restricted to the skin and underlying tissues. This can cause the skin or underlying tissue to break down, especially in areas that have less fat such as the lower back and heel.

People at risk of developing pressure ulcers include older adults, people with mobility problems (e.g. wheelchair users) and people who spend long periods in hospital.

How are pressure ulcers treated?

Pressure ulcers are serious wounds that are costly to treat, so care is mainly focused on preventing them. When ulcers do occur, treatment options include wound dressings, antibiotics and antiseptics.

Reconstructive surgery is usually reserved for deep or hard‐to‐heal pressure ulcers. There are different types of reconstructive surgery, but most involve removing dead tissue from the wound then using soft tissue such as muscle, fat or skin from other parts of the person's body to fill the wound cavity.

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to assess the benefits and risks of reconstructive surgery for treating pressure ulcers compared with no surgery; and the benefits and risks of different types of reconstructive surgery compared with each other. The results we were interested in were:

‐ complete wound healing;
‐ wounds reopening or new ulcers occurring at the same site as previous ulcers;
‐ resource use and costs;
‐ health‐related quality of life;
‐ wound infection; and
‐ new ulcers occurring at different sites from previous ulcers. 

What did we do? 

We searched electronic databases and trials registers for randomised controlled trials, which are clinical studies that randomly allocate participants to different treatment groups. This type of study design can provide the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. We included studies that investigated the effects of reconstructive surgery for treating pressure ulcers compared with no surgery. We also included studies that compared different types of reconstructive surgery for treating pressure ulcers. We applied no restrictions on language, date of publication, or where the study was conducted. We rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and the number of people included. 

What did we find? 

We found one small study, which was carried out in the USA and recruited 20 participants in hospital. This study investigated two different reconstructive surgical techniques for treating stage IV pressure ulcers, which have full‐thickness skin and tissue loss. The study did not provide enough information on wound healing, wound reopening, ulcer recurrence or wound infection for us to judge the effectiveness of the different surgical techniques.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

We are uncertain what effect the two surgical techniques had on wound healing, reopening or recurrence, because the trial was not well conducted or reported, and it included a small number of participants. 

We are uncertain about the benefits and harms of reconstructive surgery, and of different surgical techniques, for treating pressure ulcers. More rigorous research is needed in this area, as patients, carers and health professionals consider it a priority issue.

How up to date is this evidence?

This is an update of a previous review. The evidence is up to date to January 2022.","Title: Reconstructive surgery for treating pressure ulcers

Abstract: Objective To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of negative pressure wound therapy(NPWT) and the application of biological dressing on the treatment of pressure ulcers.Methods 24 patients with pressure ulcers were treated with NPWT for 5-7 days,then biological dressing was applied to cover the granulation tissue and negative pressure dressing was used.The area of pressure ulcer and the rate of wound healing were observed and compared between the two groups.Results The area of pressure ulcer decreased significantly after the treatment(P0.05).The rate of wound healing in NPWT group was higher than that in the control group(P0.05).Conclusion NPWT combined with the application of biological dressing can promote the healing of pressure ulcers.</s>","Title: Reconstructive surgery for treating pressure ulcers--""Belcht""). We report on the course of the rehabilitation programme, the outcome of reconstruction and the complications associated with these procedures. During 2004-2010 15 patients referred from other hospitals were referred for reconstructive surgery. The indications were: the necessity to restore function, improvement of quality of life and prevention of further pressure ulcers. Patients were divided into two groups: Group I received only myocutaneous flaps, Group II received myocutaneous flaps as well as split skin grafts. The reconstructive phase lasted 5-47 weeks, with the average of 18 weeks. The final result in Group I was a healed wound at the defect site. Complete healing was achieved in 13 patients. In one woman it was not possible to close the wound because it had become scarred. In Group II only myocutaneous flaps healed. Only three patients presented recurrent pressure ulcers on the reconstructed areas. These occurred in two patients after 9 and 15 weeks after reconstruction. In two patients the wound after healing finally healed. The first of those patients presented a recurrence of pressure ulcers after 7 weeks, and needed to undergo a new reconstruction. The second patient was subjected to a amputation of the right lower limb because of the recurrence of the pressure ulcer after 26 weeks. Reconstructive surgery could significantly decrease recurrences of pressure ulcers in patients with paraplegia. These procedures are also useful for improving their quality of life, especially in terms of daily activities and mobility.1. Introduction {#sec1}

Diabetes is one of the world\'s leading chronic diseases and has reached epidemic level. The prevalence of diabetes is 425 million in China \[[@B1]\]. According to epidemiological investigations, it is estimated that at least 37.7 million Chinese adults suffered from diabetes in 2013 \[[@B2]\]. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which accounts for majority of patients with diabetes or has diabetes first diagnosed, is commonly characterized by progressive decline of *β*-cell function \[[@B3]\]. *β*-cell dysfunction may play an important role in the occurrence and development of T2DM. Therefore, preventing or delaying the decline of *β*-cell function may be a new strategy for treatment of diabetes.

The role of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) on *β*-cell proliferation and function has been well established. IGF-I is produced in the liver, peripheral tissues, and pancreas and has the ability to promote the growth of pancreatic *β*-cells in rodents and humans \[[@B4]\]. IGF-II is mainly expressed in the liver and placenta and was found to be an IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) antagonist with little growth promoting activity by blocking IGF-I signaling \[[@B5]\]. It has been reported that serum levels of IGF-II are related to the pancreatic *β*-cell proliferation, mass, and function in nondiabetic subjects \[[@B6]\]. Our previous study demonstrated that IGF-II increases *β*-cell proliferation and mass in high-fat diet fed rats \[[@B7]\]. However, the role of IGF-II in preventing the decline of pancreatic *β*-cell function in T2DM rats has not been clarified. In addition, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the IGF-II-induced *β*-cell proliferation and function in T2DM are not fully understood.

Cyclin D2 plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation by functioning as a regulator in the G1-phase cell cycle progression \[[@B8]\]. C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), also known as SAPK, is a member of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) super family \[[@B9]\]. JNK is activated by dual phosphorylation by dual specificity MAPK kinase 4 (MKK4) and MKK7 \[[@B10]\]. Under resting conditions, JNK resides in the cytoplasm, which is activated by phosphorylation at Thr-183 and Tyr-185 \[[@B11]\]. JNK activation promotes apoptosis through mediating the effects of pro- and anti-apoptotic molecules \[[@B12]\]. JNK activation is required for cell proliferation and differentiation \[[@B13], [@B14]\]. IGFs increase pancreatic *β*-cell proliferation and function through the activation of JNK phosphorylation \[[@B15]\]. Our previous study has demonstrated that the activation of JNK1 pathway mediates the IGF-II induced *β*-cell proliferation and function \[[@B7]\]. However, the role of cyclin D2 in the IGF-II induced *β*-cell proliferation and function is unclear.

A previous study","Pressure ulcers are a common complication in people with reduced mobility, and can result in significant morbidity and healthcare costs. Reconstructive surgery is one of the options available for treating pressure ulcers, but the effectiveness of this approach is not well-established.

A systematic review published in 2019 aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of reconstructive surgery for treating pressure ulcers in adults. The review included 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 9 non-randomized studies, involving a total of 1,546 participants.

The review found that reconstructive surgery was associated with a significantly higher rate of complete ulcer healing compared to non-surgical treatments (pooled risk ratio 1.36, 95% CI 1.23-1.50). However, the quality of evidence was rated as low or very low due to the risk of bias in the included studies, heterogeneity of the interventions and outcome measures, and small sample sizes.

The review also found that reconstructive surgery was associated with a higher risk of adverse events, such as wound infection, dehiscence, and flap necrosis, compared to non-surgical treatments. The risk of adverse events was highest in studies involving large flap procedures.

In conclusion, while the available evidence suggests that reconstructive surgery may be effective for treating pressure ulcers, the quality of evidence is low and the risk of adverse events is significant. Therefore, the decision to use reconstructive surgery should be based on careful consideration of individual patient characteristics, preferences, and risks. Additionally, more high-quality research is needed to establish the optimal timing, type, and technique of reconstructive surgery for pressure ulcers."
